<p>William H. Hamilton, Engineer, Charles G.
Hargus, Clerk, Thomas Burns, Pilot, masters
in their several professions. From each of
them I learned something that has made life
better worth living, the sum of which makes
possible these reminiscences of a "cub" pilot.

<h2><a name="prelude"></a>Prelude</h2>
</div>

<p>The majesty and glory of the Great River have departed;
its glamour remains, fresh and undying, in the memories of those
who, with mind's eye, still can see it as it was a half-century ago.
Its majesty was apparent in the mighty flood which then flowed
throughout the season, scarcely diminished by the summer heat;
its glory, in the great commerce which floated upon its bosom,
the beginnings of mighty commonwealths yet to be. Its glamour
is that indefinable witchery with which memory clothes the commonplace
of long ago, transfiguring the labors, cares, responsibilities,
and dangers of steamboat life as it really was, into a
Midsummer Night's Dream of care-free, exhilarating experiences,
and glorified achievement.</p>

<p>Of the river itself it may be said, that like the wild tribes
which peopled its banks sixty years ago, civilization has been its
undoing. The primeval forests which spread for hundreds of
miles on either side, then caught and held the melting snows and
falling rains of spring within spongy mosses which carpeted the
earth; slowly, throughout the summer, were distilled the waters
from myriad springs, and these, filling brooks and smaller rivers,
feeders of the Great River, maintained a mighty volume of water
the season through. Upon the disappearance of the forests, the
melting snows and early rains having no holding grounds, are
carried quickly to the river, which as quickly rises to an abnormal
stage in the early part of the season, to be followed by a dearth
which later reduces the Mississippi to the dimensions of a second-rate
stream, whereon navigation is impossible for great steamers,
and arduous, disheartening and unprofitable for boats of any class.</p>

<p>To most men of our day, the life of those who manned the
steamers of that once mighty fleet is legendary, almost mythical.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Its story is unwritten. To the few participants who yet remain,
it is but a memory. The boats themselves have disappeared,
leaving no token. The masters and the mates, the pilots and
the clerks, the engineers and the men of humbler station have
likewise gone. Of the thousands who contributed to give life
and direction to the vessels themselves, a meager score of short
biographies is all that history vouchsafes.</p>

<p>The aim of the present volume is to tell something of these
men, and of the boats that they made sentient by their knowledge
and power; to relate something of the incidents of river life as
seen by a boy during eight years of residence by the riverside,
or in active service on the river itself. While it may not literally
be claimed, "All of which I saw," it is with satisfaction, not
unmixed with pride, that the writer can truthfully assert, "A part
of which I was."</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_1"></a>Chapter I<br />
<i>Early Impressions</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Descent from an ancestry whose members built and sailed
ships from Salem, Newburyport, and Nantucket two hundred
years ago, and even down to the early days of the nineteenth
century, ought to give an hereditary bias toward a sailor's life, on
waters either salt or fresh. A score-and-a-half of men of my
name have "died with their boots on" at sea, from the port of
Nantucket alone. They went for whales, and the whales got
them. Perhaps their fate should have discouraged the sea-going
instinct, but perversely it had the opposite effect. A hundred
men are lost out of Gloucester every year, yet their boys are on
the "Banks" before they are fairly weaned.</p>

<p>I was born at Niles, Michigan, on the historic St. Joseph
River, which in those days was of considerable importance commercially.
Scores of keel boats plied between South Bend and
the mouth of the river at St. Joseph, on Lake Michigan. Keel
boats drifted down the river, and after unloading were towed
back by little steamboats, about eighty feet long by eighteen feet
beam. These were propelled by side wheels attached to a single
shaft, driven by a horizontal engine of indifferent power. These
steamers towed four "keels" upstream at the rate of five or six
miles an hour. The former had no upper cabin answering to
the "boiler deck" of the Mississippi River boats&mdash;only a roof
covering the main deck, with the passenger cabin aft, and the
quarters of the crew forward of the boiler and engine.</p>

<p>It was, I suppose, a quarter of a mile from my birthplace
to the river bank where we boys of the neighborhood went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
see the steamboats pass. In the opposite direction, around a sharp
bend and across the low-lying, alluvial land, which comprised the
home farm, the river was discernible a mile away. When a boat
was seen coming up river, the alarm was given, and we little
shavers of the neighborhood raced for the nearest point of view,
a high bank of blue clay, rising probably seventy-five feet above
the river. We used to think it was as many hundreds of feet;
and what I now know as the quarter mile, then stretched away
into interminable distances as it was measured by the stubby yet
sturdy little legs of six-year-old runners. On the edge of this
blue-clay bank, I received my first impressions in river piloting.</p>

<p>My teacher in these matters was a man whom I greatly
envied. Kimball Lyon lived in a house three times as large as
that in which I was born. His father had left a big farm and a
bank account of fabulous dimensions. We knew it was large,
because "Kim" never worked as other young men of twenty-five
or thirty years did in those days. His mother always kept a "hired
man", while Kim toiled not; but he spun.</p>

<p>It was not his riches, however, nor his immunity from toil,
that common lot of other men, which excited the envy of the
six-year-olds. He could, and did, play on the accordion. Lying
on his back in the shade and resting one corner of his instrument
upon his bosom, with irresistible power and pathos he sang and
played</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"A life on the ocean wave,</div>
<div class="verse">A home on the rolling deep."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It appealed to all the natural impulses of our being, and
the dormant instincts inherited from generations of whale-hunting
ancestors were aroused by the power of music, reinforced by the
suggestive words of the song itself; and then and there we vowed
that when we were men like Kimball Lyon, we too would own
and play upon accordions, and do all else that he had done; for
marvelous tales he told, of his experiences in great storms at
sea and of deeds of aquatic prowess. We learned in after years
that "Kim" once sailed from St. Joseph to Chicago in a sawed-off
lumber hooker, when the wind was west nor'west, down the lake,
and that he did actually lie on the deck, but not on his back,
and that it was not music which he emitted, and that the sailors
railed at him, and that he came back from Chicago by stage coach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
to Niles. But we didn't know this when he was awakening
our viking instincts, as we lay on the banks of the old St. Joe
in the sunny summer days of long ago.</p>

<p>"Kim" Lyon knew all about steamboats, as well as about
deep sea ships, and when we asked questions he could answer
out of the fullness of his knowledge. We wondered what made
the wheels go 'round, and he told us. I have forgotten <i>what</i>
made them go 'round, but my recollection is that it was a peculiar
mechanical process of which I have never seen the like in any
other service on river, lake or ocean. His answer to the query
as to "what is the man in the little house on top of the boat
doing?" I have never forgotten, as it afterward came more in
my line of business. The man was twisting the wheel as all
pilots before and since that time twist it, a spoke or two to
port, a half dozen to starboard, hard up and hard down, there
being a shallow piece of river just there, beset with big boulders
and reefs of gravel, through which he was cautiously worming
his boat and its kite-tail of keels.</p>

<p>"That man," said Kimball, "is drawing water from a well
in the bottom of the boat and emptying it into the boiler, just
as your father draws water from his well with a rope, a bucket
and a crank. If he should stop for a minute the boiler would
burst for want of water, the boat would blow up, and we should
all be killed by the explosion."</p>

<p>This definition at once gave us a personal interest in the
work of the man at the wheel; we all felt that our lives depended
upon this man's devotion to his duty. Had he struck a piece of
"easy water" at that time, and centred his wheel, there is no
doubt that we would have scurried for home before the inevitable
explosion should occur. That was my first lesson in piloting.
Perhaps this childish concern that the man "drawing water for the
boilers" should faithfully perform his duty, was but a prefigurement
of the interest with which the writer, and hundreds of
others, in later years, have watched the pilot work his boat
through a tangled piece of river, knowing that the safety of all
depended upon the knowledge and faithfulness of the "man at
the wheel."</p>

<p>The steamboats plying on the St. Joe were crude little
affairs, and there were but four or five of them, all alike. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
remember the name of but one, the "Algoma"; the others are
quite forgotten. Doubtless they were commonplace, and did not
appeal to the poetic side of the boy. But "Algoma"! The word
has a rhythmical measure, and conjures up visions of wigwams,
council fires, dusky maidens, and painted braves. An Indian
name would stick when all the saints in the calendar were forgotten.
The "Algoma" and her consorts have gone the way of
all steamboats. The railroad came and killed their business, just
as a few years later, it did on the Great River.</p>

<p>A few years later I saw the Mississippi River for the first
time, at Rock Island, Illinois; and through the kindness of another
well-posted bystander to whom the then twelve-year-old boy
appealed, I received my first impressions of a stern-wheel boat.
There were two steamboats lying at the levee&mdash;the "Minnesota
Belle", a side-wheeler, upon which we had taken passage, while
just above lay the "Luella", a stern-wheeler. I knew about the
former variety from observation on the St. Joe, but I had never
seen even a picture of one of the latter sort, so it was a novelty.
I wasn't certain that it was a steamboat at all, and after referring
the matter to my stranger friend, I learned definitely that it
wasn't. The "Luella's" wheel was slowly turning over as she
lay at the levee, and as I did not comprehend the mechanical
details of that kind of craft I began asking questions. My mentor
assured me that the "Luella" was not a steamboat at all, but a
water power sawmill. The big wheel then moving was driven
by the current, and it in turn operated the sawmill machinery
on the inside of the boat. As I could not figure any other use
for a wheel out in the open, at the end of the boat, instead of
on the side where it ought to be, and as I had no reason to doubt
the statement of my informant, I readily accepted the sawmill
explanation, and hastened to confide my newly-acquired knowledge
to my brother and other members of the family. A few hours
later both boats pulled out for St. Paul. After she had rounded
the first point, ahead of us, we saw nothing more of the "Luella"
until we met her coming down the river on her return trip.
She was a heavily-powered boat, and showed her heels to the
larger and slower "Minnesota Belle". The sight of the "Luella"
kicking her way upstream at the rate of two miles to our one,
not only dissipated the sawmill impression, but taught me not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
accept at face value all information communicated by glib-tongued
and plausible strangers.</p>

<p>That steamboat trip from Rock Island to Prescott was one
long holiday excursion for us two small and lively boys from
Michigan. There was so much to see and in so many different
directions at once, that it was impossible to grasp it all, although
we scampered over the deck to get differing view points. We
met dozens of boats, going back to St. Louis or Galena after
further loads of immigrants and freight; and there were other
boats which came up behind us, gaining slowly but surely, and
finally passing the deeply-laden "Belle". There were landings
to be made, and freight and passengers to be disembarked. There
were strange Indians to be seen&mdash;we were familiar enough with
Michigan tribesmen, having been born within a mile or two of
old Pokagon's tribal village. There were boys with fish for sale,
fish larger than any inhabiting the waters of Michigan streams,
sturgeons only excepted, and this promised well for the fun in
store when we should reach our journey's end.</p>

<p>Finally, on a bright June day in the year 1854, the writer,
then a boy of twelve, with his brother, three years younger, were
fully transplanted from their Michigan birthplace to the row of
stores and warehouses which fronted on the "levee" at Prescott,
Wisconsin, where the waters of St. Croix River and Lake join
the Mississippi. The town was then a typical frontier settlement.
Two hundred white people were planted among five hundred
Chippewa Indians; with as many more Sioux, of the Red Wing
band, across the river in Minnesota, a few miles lower down
the river. The not infrequent outbreaks of the hereditary enmity
existing between these ancient foes, would expend itself on
the streets of the town in war whoops, gunpowder, and scalping
knives, enlivening the experience of the average citizen as he
dodged behind the nearest cover to avoid stray bullets; while the
city marshal was given an opportunity to earn his salary, by
driving out both bands of hostiles at the point of his revolver.</p>

<p><a id="Page_20"></a></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_2"></a>Chapter II<br />
<i>Indians, Dugouts, and Wolves</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In that early day when my acquaintance with the Mississippi
began, Indians were numerous. Their dugouts lay at the levee
by the dozen, the hunters retailing the ducks and geese, or venison
and bear meat, which had fallen to their guns, while the squaws
peddled catfish and pickerel that had been ensnared on the hooks
and lines of the women and children of the party.</p>

<p>Situated as Prescott was at the junction of the St. Croix with
the Mississippi, its citizens were favored with visits both from the
Chippewa, who hunted and fished along the former stream and its
tributaries in Wisconsin, and the Sioux, who made the bottom
lands on the Minnesota side of the river, between Hastings and
Red Wing, their home and hunting ground. This was the
boundary line which had existed for a hundred years or more;
although the Sioux (or Dakota) laid claim to many thousand
square miles of hunting grounds in Wisconsin, for which they
actually received a million and a half dollars when they quit-claimed
it to the United States. Their claim to any lands on
the east side of the river had been disputed by the Chippewa from
time out of mind; and these rival claims had occasionally been, as
we have seen, referred to the only court of arbitration which the
Indians recognized&mdash;that of the tomahawk and scalping knife.</p>

<p>As a boy I have spent many an hour searching in the sands
at the foot of the bluffs below Prescott, for arrowheads, rusted
remnants of knives and hatchets, and for the well-preserved brass
nails with which the stocks and butts of old-time trade muskets
were plentifully ornamented. Just how many years ago that
battle had been fought, does not appear to be a matter of historical
record. That it was fiercely contested, is abundantly proven by
the great amount of wreckage of the fight which the white lads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of Prescott recovered to be sold to tourists on the steamboats which
touched at our levee. The Indians themselves had a tradition
that it was a bloody fight. Taking the word of a Chippewa
narrator, one was easily convinced that hundreds of Sioux bit
the sand on that eventful day. If the narrator happened to belong
across the river, one felt assured, after listening to his version,
that the Chippewa met their Marathon on this battle plain. In
any case the treasure trove indicated a very pretty fight, whichever
party won the field.</p>

<p>Charlevoix, the French historian, relates that in 1689 Le Seuer
established a fortified trading post on the west side of the Mississippi,
about eight miles below the present site of Hastings. In
speaking of this fort, he says:</p>

<p class="blockquote2">
"The island has a beautiful prairie, and the French of Canada have
made it a centre of commerce for the western parts, and many pass the
winter here, because it is a good country for hunting."</p>

<p>As a boy I have many a time visited the site of this ancient
stronghold, and hobnobbed with the Indians then occupying the
ground, descendants of those with whom the French fraternized
two hundred years ago. At this point the islands are about four
miles across from the main channel of the river; the islands
being formed by Vermillion Slough, which heads at Hastings,
reëntering the river about two and a half miles above Red Wing.
Trudell Slough, which heads in the river about four miles below
Prescott, joins Vermillion at the point at which was probably
located Le Seuer's post. At the juncture of the two sloughs there
was a beautiful little prairie of several acres. On the west, the
bluffs rose several hundred feet to the level prairie which constitutes
the upper bench. Just at this point there are three mounds
rising fifty to seventy-five feet above the level of the prairie, and
serving as a landmark for miles around. Whether they are of
geological origin or the work of the Indians in their mound-building
epoch, had not been determined in my day. There are
other prominences of like character everywhere about, and it
would seem that they were erected by the hand of man.</p>

<p>On the north, east, and south the islands afforded good
hunting grounds for the French and their allies. In 1854 and
later (I think even yet), the site of this ancient fort was occupied
by a band of Sioux Indians of Red Wing's tribe, under the sub-chieftaincy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of a French half-breed named Antoine Mouseau
(Mo'-sho). In Neill's history of the settlement of St. Paul he
mentions Louis Mouseau as one of the first settlers occupying, in
1839, a claim lying at the lower end of Dayton Bluff, about two
miles down the river from the levee. This Antoine Mouseau, a
man about forty in 1854, was probably a son of the St. Paul
pioneer and of a squaw of Red Wing's band.</p>

<p>In the days when the white boys of Prescott made adventurous
trips "down to Mo-sho's", the islands were still remarkably rich
in game&mdash;deer, bear, wolves, 'coons, mink, muskrats, and other
fur-bearing animals; and in spring and fall the extensive rice
swamps literally swarmed with wild fowl. Two or three of the
adventures which served to add spice to such visits as we made
with the little red men of Mouseau's tribe, will serve to illustrate
the sort of life which was led by all Prescott boys in those early
days. They seemed to be a part of the life of the border, and
were taken as a matter of course. Looking back from this distance,
and from the civilization of to-day, it seems miraculous to
me that all of those boys were not drowned or otherwise summarily
disposed of. As a matter of fact none of them were
drowned, and to the best of my knowledge none of them have
as yet been hanged. Most of them went into the Union army in
the War of Secession, and some of them are sleeping where the
laurel and magnolia bend over their last resting places.</p>

<p>The water craft with which the white boys and Indian boys
alike traversed the river, rough or smooth, and explored every
creek, bayou, and slough for miles around, were "dug-outs"&mdash;canoes
hollowed out of white pine tree trunks. Some canoes were
large and long, and would carry four or five grown persons.
Those owned and used by the boys were from six to eight feet
long, and just wide enough to take in a not too-well-developed
lad; but then, all the boys were lean and wiry. It thus happened
that the Blaisdells, the Boughtons, the Fifields, the Millers, the
Merricks, the Schasers, the Smiths, and the Whipples, and several
other pairs and trios ranging from fourteen years down to seven,
were pretty generally abroad from the opening of the river in
the spring until its closing in the fall, hunting, fishing and
exploring, going miles away, up or down the river or lake, and
camping out at night, often without previous notice to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
mothers. With a "hunk" of bread in their pockets, some matches
to kindle a fire, a gun and fishlines, they never were in danger
of starvation, although always hungry.</p>

<p>One of the incidents referred to, I accept more on the evidence
of my brother than of my own consciousness of the situation when
it occurred. He was eleven at the time, and I fourteen. We
each had a little pine "dug-out", just large enough to carry one
boy sitting in the stern, and a reasonable cargo of ducks, fish
or fruit. With such a load the gunwales of the craft were
possibly three or four inches above the water line. The canoe
itself was round on the bottom, and could be rolled over and
over by a boy lying flat along the edges, with his arms around
it, as we often did for the amusement of passengers on the boats&mdash;rolling
down under water and coming up on the other side, all
the time holding fast to the little hollowed-out log. Such a
craft did not appear to be very seaworthy, nor well calculated
to ride over rough water. Indeed, under the management of a
novice they would not stay right side up in the calmest water.</p>

<p>For the boys who manned them, however, whether whites
or Indians, they were as seaworthy as Noah's ark, and much
easier to handle. A show piece much in vogue, was to stand
on the edge of one of these little round logs (not over eight
feet long), and with a long-handled paddle propel the thing
across the river. This was not always, nor usually, accomplished
without a ducking; but it often was accomplished by white boys
without the ducking, and that even when there was some wind
and little waves. The Indian lads would not try it in public.
For one thing, it was not consonant with Indian dignity; for
another, an Indian, big or little, dislikes being laughed at, and
a ducking always brought a laugh when there were any spectators.
I cannot, after all these years, get over an itching to
try this experiment again. I believe that I could balance myself
all right; but the difference between sixty pounds and a hundred
and sixty might spoil the game.</p>

<p>Some boys, more fortunate than others, were from time to
time possessed of birch-bark canoes&mdash;small ones. Of all the
craft that ever floated, the birch-bark comes nearer being the
ideal boat than any other. So light is it, that it may be carried
on the head and shoulders for miles without great fatigue; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
it sits on the water like a whiff of foam&mdash;a veritable fairy
craft. It was the custom of the boys who owned these little
"birches" to shove them off the sand with a run, and when they
were clear of the land to jump over the end, and standing erect,
paddle away like the wind. This was another show piece, and
was usually enacted for the benefit of admiring crowds of Eastern
passengers on the steamboats.</p>

<p>On one such occasion, a young man from the East who
professed to be a canoeist, and who possibly was an expert with
an ordinary canoe, came off the boat, and after crossing the
palm of the birch-bark's owner with a silver piece, proposed to
take a little paddle by himself. The boy was an honest boy,
as boys averaged then and there, and although not averse to
having a little fun at the expense of the stranger, in his capacity
of lessor he deemed it his duty to caution his patron that a birch-bark
was about as uncertain and tricky a proposition as any one
would wish to tackle&mdash;especially such a little one as his own
was. He proposed to hold it until his passenger had stepped in and
sat down and was ready to be shoved off. This was the usual
procedure, and it had its good points for the average tourist. But
this one had seen the boys shoving the same canoe off the sand
and jumping over the stern, and he proposed to do the same
thing, because he was used to canoes himself. Against the cautions
of the owner he <i>did</i> shove off and jump, but he did not alight
in the canoe. That elfish little piece of Indian deviltry was not
there when he arrived; it slipped out from under him, sidewise,
and with a spring which jumped it almost clear of the water
it sailed away before the wind, while the canoeist went headfirst
into six or eight feet of water, silk hat, good clothes and
all, amid the howls of delight from the passengers on the steamer
who had been watching him. He was game, however, and
admitted that he had never imagined just how light and ticklish
a birch-bark was; nor how much science it required to jump
<i>squarely</i> over the stern of such a fragile creation and maintain
one's balance. Woodmen and canoeists familiar with "birches"
will understand just how small a deviation is required to bring
discomfiture. A little carelessness on the part of an old hand
is often just as fatal as a little ignorance on the part of the
tenderfoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
But I digress. On the trip concerning which I started to
tell, my brother and I had been down to the Indian village and
were on our way home. When we emerged from Trudell Slough
we found a gale blowing from the south, against the current of
the river, and great combing waves were running, through which
it seemed impossible to ride in our little boats. However, we
had to cross the river in order to get home, and we did not
long debate the question. Being the oldest I took the lead, Sam
following. He was but eleven years old, and had a boat all by
himself to manage in that sea. But he could paddle a canoe as
well as any Indian boy. I also could paddle, and being older,
nearly fourteen, was supposed to have the wisdom of the ages
in the matter of judgment in meeting and riding combers.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, I started out to make the crossing.
My brother has told me since that he never thought of any
danger to himself; but he figured, a dozen times, that I was
gone&mdash;in fact he lost three or four good bets that I would not
come up again after going down out of sight. My canoe would go
down into the trough of the sea at the same time that his did,
thus he would lose track of me. He had to keep his eyes on
the "combers" and meet them at just the right angle, or he
himself would have been the "goner". Sometimes he would not
locate me until he had met three or four big ones. Then he
would rise over the tops of the waves at the same time and
would be able to reassure himself that I was still right side up
and paddling for life, and that he was out another bet. I do
not know that I thought of the danger at all, as I simply had
my canoe to look out for. Had Sam been in front I would
have realized, as he did, that we were taking lots of chances,
and would have learned from the diving of his craft just how
great the danger really was, as he did. We shipped a good deal
of water&mdash;that is, a good deal for the amount we could afford
to take in and maintain any margin between the gunwales of
our canoes and the water outside. Before we got across we were
sitting in several inches of water, but a little baling cleared this
out as soon as we reached the Wisconsin side, and we proceeded
up the river, hugging the shore and keeping in the eddies and
under the points, without further adventures. I do not think
we mentioned the crossing as anything to brag of, as under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
circumstances any of the boys would have done the same thing
in the same way.</p>

<p>One other incident in which the little canoe figured, involved
the closest call to drowning I ever had as a boy. Again I was
out with my brother, some ten miles down the river, near Diamond
Bluff, fishing and scouting about in the customary manner. Sam
was ahead of me, and had landed on a pile of driftwood lodged
against a giant cottonwood which had been undermined by the
eating away of the river bank. In falling, one or more of its
branches had been so deeply driven into the bottom of the river
that it held at right angles with the current, extending out fifty
feet or more into the channel. Against this obstruction all sorts
of logs, lumber, and other drift had lodged, forming a large
raft. My brother had run in under the lower side of this and
climbed out, preparatory to dropping his line for fish. I, doubtless
carelessly, drifted down toward the upper side. One of the
limbs which did not quite reach the surface so as to be seen, caught
my little vessel and in an instant I was in the water, and under
the raft. I thought I was surely gone, for I supposed that the
driftwood was deep enough to catch and hold me. I had presence
of mind enough left, however, to do the only thing which was
left&mdash;dive as deeply as possible, and with open eyes steer clear of
the many branches through which I had to find my way toward
the open water on the lee side of the raft. Sam ran to the lower
side to catch me if I came up&mdash;an expectation which he had little
hope of realizing, thinking as I did that I would be caught like
a rat in a trap, and never come up until dug out. Fortunately
the drift was not deep, and the limbs not very close together, and
I popped up as I cleared the last log, but with so little breath
left that another ten feet would have drowned me. Sam caught
me by the hand and "yanked" me out on the drift, where I lay
and took in air for some minutes to fill out my collapsed lungs.
In another ten minutes we were fishing as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>In these upsets which we were almost daily experiencing, our
costumes played an important though passive part. The entire
uniform of the average river lad of those days consisted of a
pair of blue jean trousers, a calico shirt, a home-made straw hat,
and sometimes a pair of "galluses". The last named item indicated
an extravagant expenditure; one "gallus" was ample for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
practical purposes; the second represented luxury and wanton
extravagance. With such a costume a boy in the water was
practically unhampered, and could and did swim with all the
freedom of an unclothed cupid. One of the customary relaxations
of the Prescott boys was to run down Orange Street when school
"let out", in single file, dressed as above described, hats and all,
and dive from the ledge of rocks fifteen feet high into water
forty feet deep.</p>

<p>It was on one of these excursions that I had the only real
scare of my life. This may sound like braggadocio, but it is a
fact. I have been in places since that time, where I thought
death imminent, and knew that it was possible, if not probable,
at any moment; but in such situations I have more or less
successfully been able to conceal the fact of fear. In the case in
question I did not attempt to conceal from myself the fact that I
was sincerely alarmed.</p>

<p>We had, late in the autumn, landed at a desolate <i>coulee</i>
several miles below Prescott. I had gone back about half a mile
from the river, on to the prairie, leaving my brother at the canoe.
Suddenly I heard the long-drawn hunting cry of a wolf. Looking
in the direction of the sound I saw a big grey timber wolf
loping toward me with the speed of a race horse. His cries were
answered from a distance, and then I saw six other big wolves
bounding over the prairie after me.</p>

<p>I looked around for some place of safety and saw at some
distance&mdash;a good deal less than a quarter of a mile, as I know
it now, but it looked all of that at the time&mdash;a small burr oak,
the only tree near enough to be available in this crisis. I knew
enough about the big timber wolves to know that I would instantly
be in ribbons after they were upon me. One alone might be
kept off; but seven would have the courage of numbers, and
would make short work of a single boy. Then I was scared.
I could actually feel every hair upon my head standing straight
on end, as stiff as Hamlet's "quills upon the fretful porcupine".
It has been worth all that it cost, this hair-raising experience,
as an interpretation of the much-quoted expression from the
immortal Bard of Avon.</p>

<p>A good runner, I had a full half mile the start of the leading
wolf. I did not wait for him greatly to diminish the lead, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
"lit out" for the little burr oak. I covered the ground in the
shortest time I had ever devoted to a like distance, and although
very nearly winded jumped for the lower limbs and pulled myself
up just in time to escape the teeth of the forward beast. In
another minute there were seven of them, leaping to within a
few feet of my legs as I stood on a branch of the small tree, as
high up as I dared to go.</p>

<p>My brother had heard the cries of the wolves, and running
to the top of the bank had watched the race with great interest.
When the tree was safely reached he shouted to me to hold on
and he would go for help, and he at once started for Prescott,
four miles away, against the current. For some reason which
I have never been able to explain, the wolves, after yelping and
leaping for an hour or so, suddenly started off across the prairie,
and when they had gone a mile away I climbed down and ran
for home. In the meantime my hair had resumed its normal
position, and never since, under any circumstances, have I experienced
a like sensation. I presume that the thought of being
torn to pieces by the wolves, a contingency which seemingly was
quite probable, added a horror to the imminence of death which
was not present at a time when there was an equal chance of
being drowned. It was not because I did not know all about
wolves, for I did. Their cries were familiar sounds in that wild
country, and their ferocity had been proven time and again; but
I had never heard nor seen them when it meant quite so much to
me, nor when the chances seemed so slim.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_3"></a>Chapter III<br />
<i>On the Levee at Prescott</i></h2>
</div>

<p>When we first knew it, Prescott was in many respects a
typical river town. But in one, it differed from all others with
the possible exception of Wacouta and Reed's Landing. "Towing
through" had not then been inaugurated. The great rafts of
logs and lumber from Stillwater and the upper St. Croix, were
pushed to Prescott by towboats from Stillwater, at the head of
the lake. From there to Lake Pepin they drifted. They were
again pushed through that lake by other boats, and from Reed's
Landing, at the foot of the lake, drifted to their destination at
Winona, La Crosse, Clinton, Le Claire, or Hannibal.</p>

<p>The necessary preparation for the trip down river was
made at Prescott. Stores of pork, beans, flour, molasses, and
whiskey were laid in. The hundreds of rough men who handled
the great steering oars on these rafts spent their money in the
saloons which lined the river front and adjacent streets, filling
themselves with noxious liquors, and often ending their "sprees"
with a free fight between rival crews. A hundred men would
join in the fray, the city marshal sitting on a "snubbing post",
revolver in hand, watching the affair with the enlightened eye
of an expert and the enjoyment of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>Prescott was also a transfer point for freight consigned to
Afton, Lakeland, Hudson, Stillwater, Osceola, and St. Croix
Falls. The large boats, unless they were heavily freighted for
Stillwater and Hudson, did not make the run of thirty miles up
the lake. The freight was put ashore at Prescott, and reshipped
on the smaller boats plying between Prescott and St. Croix River
points. This made necessary large warehouses in which to store
the transshipped goods. My father, L. H. Merrick, engaged in
this business of storing and transshipping, as well as dealing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
boat-stores and groceries. Buying one warehouse on the levee,
he started a store in the basement, which opened directly on to
the levee. Moving his family into the two upper stories, he
began at once the erection of a second and larger warehouse.
These being insufficient for his business, he bought, in 1855, a
third warehouse. These were filled, in summer, with goods in
transit, and in winter with wheat awaiting the opening of navigation
for shipment to Eastern markets, via Dunleith, Illinois,
at that time the nearest railroad connection on the river. The
name of this one-time prosperous city has, however, disappeared
from the map, to be replaced by East Dubuque.</p>

<p>From 1854 until 1858 the firm of L. H. Merrick &amp; Co.
(the company being William R. Gates, my brother-in-law) did
all the transfer and storage business for the regular packets
belonging to the Galena, Dubuque, Dunleith &amp; St. Paul Packet
Company, commonly shortened to Minnesota Packet Company, and
also for such "wild" boats as did not make the run up the lake.</p>

<p>The business was very profitable. Much of the freight
consisted of pork and beef in barrels, whiskey, sugar in hogsheads
(refined sugar was then scarcely known on the upper river), rice,
soap, etc., which, if there was no boat ready to receive it, could
be covered with tarpaulins on the levee, thus saving the cost of
putting it in the warehouses. The perishable freight and household
goods were of course stored under cover. A man was always
on duty to meet incoming boats at night, and to watch the freight
piled on the levee. Sometimes, when there was a large amount of
such freight left outside, we boys spent the night skylarking about
the piles, keeping our eyes open to see that the ubiquitous raftsmen
did not surreptitiously transfer some of the packages to the everpresent
rafts. The transfer agents paid the freight on the goods
from the lower river points to Prescott, and charged a commission
of from five to twenty-five per cent for such advance. In addition,
a charge was made for storage, whether the freight was actually
placed in the warehouse or simply covered and watched on the
levee. If the goods were from Pittsburg or St. Louis, the freight
bills were usually large, and a five per cent commission would
produce a quite respectable income. If the cargo were divided
into small lots, so much the better. No package, however small,
escaped for less than a quarter ("two bits", as money was then
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
reckoned); and in addition to the commission on the money
advanced, there was an additional charge for storage, graduated,
as I have before stated, upon the value and perishability of the
freight handled. Altogether it was a very profitable occupation
until the year 1858, when there appeared a new bidder for the
business, knocking down the rates of commission and storage,
as well as cutting the business in two by getting the agency of
many of the boats, heretofore served by the old firm.</p>

<p>My brother and myself "bunked" in the garret of the warehouse
in which we had made our temporary home. There were
two windows fronting the river, and I feel sure that at night
no steamboat ever landed at the levee without having at least
two spectators, carefully noting its distinguishing characteristics.
Was she a side-wheel or stern-wheel? Was she large or small?
Had she trimmings on her smokestack, or about the pilot house,
and if so of what description? Had she a "Texas", or no
"Texas"? Were the outside blinds painted white, red, or green?
What was the sound of her whistle and bell? All of these points,
and many others, were taken in, and indelibly impressed upon
our memories, so that if the whistle or bell were again heard, perhaps
months afterward, the name of the boat could be given
with almost unfailing accuracy. It was a part of the education
of the "levee rats", as the boys were called. A boy that could
not distinguish by ear alone a majority of the boats landing at
the levee from year to year, was considered as deficient in his
education. Of course every boy in town could tell what craft
was coming as soon as she whistled, if she was one of the regular
"packets". Every boat had a whistle toned and tuned so that
it might be distinguished from that of any other boat of the
same line. The bells, which were always struck as the boat
came into the landing, also differed widely in tone. There was
one, the music of which will live in my memory so long as life
lasts. The tone of the "Ocean Wave's" bell was deep, rich,
sonorous, and when heard at a distance on a still, clear night,
was concentrated sweetness. Were I rich I would, were it a
possibility, find that bell and hang it in some bell-less steeple
where I might hear again its splendid tones, calling not alone
to worship, but summoning for me from the misty past pictures
indelibly printed upon boyish senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
A picturesque and animated scene, was one of these night
landings; the discharge and taking on of freight, the shouting
of orders, the escaping of steam, and all the sights and sounds
which for the time transformed the levee from its usual quietude
and darkness, broken only by the faint glimmer of the watchman's
lantern and the ripple of the water upon the beach, into life,
light, and activity.</p>

<p>The advent of the electric search-light has driven from the
river one of the most picturesque of all the accessories to such
scenes as we boys looked down upon, night after night, during
the busy times of 1854 and 1855, before I myself became part
and parcel of it all. The torch, by the light of which the work
went on by night, was within an iron basket, about a foot in
diameter and eighteen inches deep, swung loosely between the
prongs of a forked iron bar or standard, which could be set in
holes in the forward deck, leaning far out over the water, so
as to allow live coals from the burning wood to fall into the
river, and not upon deck.</p>

<p>When a landing was to be made at a woodyard or a town,
the watchman filled one or perhaps two of these torch baskets
with split "light-wood", or "fat-wood"&mdash;Southern pine full of
resinous sap, which would burn fiercely, making a bright light,
illuminating the deck of the boat and the levee for hundreds of
feet around. As the boat neared the landing the pine splinters
were lighted at the furnace door, the torch being carried to place
and firmly fixed in its socket. Then came out the attending
demon who fed the burning, smoking "jack" with more pine fatwood,
and from time to time with a ladle of pulverized rosin.
The rosin would flare up with a fierce flame, followed by thick
clouds of black smoke, the melted tar falling in drops upon the
water, to float away, burning and smoking until consumed. This
addition to the other sights and sounds served more than any other
thing to give this night work a wild and weird setting. We
boys decided, on many a night, that we would "go on the river"
and feed powdered rosin and pine kindlings to torches all night
long, as the coal-black and greasy, but greatly envied white lamp-boy
did, night after night, in front of our attic windows on the
levee at Prescott. The cleaner and brighter, but very commonplace
electric light has driven the torch from the river; and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
one is to be found at all in these degenerate days it will be as
a curiosity in some historical museum.</p>

<p>And thus we grew into the very life of the river as we
grew in years. I finally attained an age when my services were
worth something in the economy of a steamboat's crew. My first
venture was made in company with one who afterward attained
rank and honor in the civil service of the state&mdash;the Honorable
Sam. S. Fifield, lieutenant-governor of Wisconsin. I have a letter
written by Mr. Fifield since I began writing these sketches, in
which he says that he recollects the writer as a "white-haired
boy, full of all sorts of pranks". I presume this description of
how I looked and what I did is correct; but forty years ago to
have applied to him any such personal description of his thatch
would have been a <i>casus belli</i> for which nothing but blood could
atone. It is white, now; at that time it was a subdued brindle,
with leanings toward straw, and a subject not lightly to be discussed
in the presence of its owner.</p>

<p>The stern-wheel steamer "Kate Cassell" wintered above the
lake&mdash;that is, above Lake Pepin&mdash;I think at Diamond Bluff,
where at the close of navigation she was caught in the ice. In
the spring her captain appeared, with an engineer, a pilot, a
steward, and possibly some other officers, and picked up the
remainder of officers and crew 'longshore. I remember that one
of my schoolmates, Nat. Blaisdell, went as assistant engineer, Russ.
Ruley as mate, and a number of longshoremen from Prescott as
deck hands, while Sam Fifield and I were pantry boys. Sam got
enough of it in a few trips between St. Paul and Rock Island. I
stayed through the season. We both were printers. Sam went
back to the case at once; I went to mine again in the fall, after
the close of navigation, and stuck type during the winter, as I also
did each returning season while on the river.</p>

<p>The next spring I engaged with "Billy" Hamilton, as a "cub"
engineer. Prior to starting out on the season's run the machinery
of the boat ("Fanny Harris") had to be put in order. There
was a regular blacksmith's forge on board. All river engineers
were, perforce, good blacksmiths, able to make anything pertaining
to the machinery which it was possible to make from wrought
iron bars with an ordinary forge and anvil, with a twelve-pound
striking hammer and a two-pound shaper. We made scores of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
extra "stirrups"&mdash;the double bolts, with nuts, that clamp the
"buckets" to the wheel-arms. We made hog-chains and chimney
guys, and, as needed, bent them into place. The boilers, engines,
and "Doctor"&mdash;the steam pump for feeding water to the boilers,
pumping out the steamer, etc.&mdash;were all overhauled and put
in perfect order. The engines were leveled and "lined up"; the
eccentrics were carefully adjusted and securely fastened; the "nigger"
hoisting engine, for handling freight and warping the boat
over sand-bars was fitted up, and a hundred other minor but
important matters were attended to, so that when steam was
raised and turned on, the wheel would "turn over", and the
boat go. Some wheels did not at first turn over, and it was not
to the credit of the man who had lined the engines and set the
eccentrics. Billy Hamilton's wheel, however, turned over the
first trial.</p>

<p>Had I followed up this line of activity under Billy's tutelage,
no doubt I would have become a capable engineer, for I liked
the work and took a genuine delight in handling machinery, a
liking which I have not yet outgrown. But there were decided
drawbacks. The reversing gear of a Mississippi River steamboat,
in old times, was like nothing else of its kind, anywhere under
the sun. The engines were of the lever and poppet-valve order,
and the reversing gear was heavy. The connecting-rod (cam-rod,
we called it) weighed at least fifty pounds, even though it was
attached to the "rock-shaft" at one end. In reversing, the end
of the connecting-rod was lifted off its hook at the bottom, the
lever thrown over, in which operation two heavy valve-levers were
raised, the rod lifted about three feet, and dropped on to the
upper hook. It was all right when you did this once or twice in
making a landing; but in a piece of "crooked river", the boat
dodging about among reefs and bars, with the bells coming faster
than you could answer them, it was another matter, and became
pretty trying work for a stripling boy; his arms could not keep
the pace.</p>

<p>Another drawback in the life of a "cub" engineer was the
fact that when in port there was no let-up to the work. In
fact, the worst part of it came then. As soon as the steamer
reached her destination at Galena, the pilots were at liberty until
the hour of sailing; not so with the engineers. We usually reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Galena Thursday evening or night, and left for up river Friday
evening. As soon as the boat was made fast the "mud-valves"
were opened, the fires drawn, the water let out of the boilers,
and the process of cleaning began. Being a slim lad, one of
my duties was to creep into the boilers through the manhole,
which was just large enough to let me through; and with a
hammer and a sharp-linked chain I must "scale" the boilers by
pounding on the two large flues and the sides with the hammer,
and sawing the chain around the flues until all the accumulated
mud and sediment was loosened. It was then washed out by
streams from the deck-hose, the force-pump being manned by
the firemen, of whom there were eight on our four-boiler boat.</p>

<p>Scaling boilers was what decided me not to persevere in the
engineering line. To lie flat on one's stomach on the top of a
twelve-inch flue, studded with rivet heads, with a space of only
fifteen inches above one's head, and in this position haul a chain
back and forth without any leverage whatever, simply by the
muscles of the arm, with the thermometer 90° in the shade, was
a practice well calculated to disillusionize any one not wholly
given over to mechanics. While I liked mechanics I knew when
I had enough, and therefore reached out for something one deck
higher. The unexpected disability of our "mud clerk", as the
second clerk is called on the river, opened the way for an ascent,
and I promptly availed myself of it.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_4"></a>Chapter IV<br />
<i>In the Engine-room</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Before leaving the main deck, with its savory scents of scorching
oil, escaping steam, and soft-coal gas, let me describe some
of the sights, sounds, and activities which impressed themselves
upon the memory of the young "cub" during his brief career as
an embryo engineer.</p>

<p>The engine-room crew of a Mississippi steamer varies as the
boat is a side-wheeler or a stern-wheeler. In my day, a stern-wheeler
carried two engineers, a "first" and a "second". The
former was chosen for his age and experience, to him being confided
the responsibility of the boat's machinery. His knowledge, care,
and oversight were depended upon to keep the engines, boilers, etc.,
in good repair, and in serviceable condition. The second engineer
received less wages, and his responsibility ended in standing his
watch, handling the engines, and in keeping enough water in the
boilers to prevent the flues from burning, as well as to avoid an
explosion. If a rival boat happened to be a little ahead or a
little behind, or alongside, and the "second" was on watch, the
margin of water between safety and danger in the boilers was
usually kept nearer the minimum than it would have been were
the "chief" in command. It is very much easier to get hot
steam with little water than with much; and hot steam is a
prime necessity when another boat is in sight, going the same
direction as your own.</p>

<p>On the "Fanny Harris", the pilots always depended upon
Billy Hamilton when in a race, as he would put on the "blowers"&mdash;the
forced draft, as it is called in polite, though less expressive
language&mdash;and never let the water get above the second gauge,
and never below the first, if he could help it. Sometimes it was
a matter of doubt where the water really was, the steam coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
pretty dry when tried by the "gauge-stick"&mdash;a broom handle,
which, pushed against the gauges, of which there were three in the
end of the boiler (three inches apart, vertically, the lower one situated
just above the water-line over the top of the flues), opened the
valve and permitted the steam and water to escape into a short
tin trough beneath. If a stream of water ran from the first and
second gauges when so tried, but not from the third, there was
a normal and healthy supply of water in the boilers. If the
water came from the first, but not from the second, the "Doctor"
was started and the supply increased. When it reached the third
gauge the supply was cut off. If, as I have seen it, there was,
when tried, none in the first or lower gauge, there followed a
guessing match as to just how far below the minimum the water
really was, and what would be the result of throwing in a supply
of cold water. The supply was always thrown in, and that
quickly, as time counts in such cases.</p>

<p>The pilot at the wheel, directly over the boilers, is in blissful
ignorance of the vital question agitating the engineer. He may
at times have his suspicions, as the escape pipes talk in a language
which tells something of the conditions existing below decks;
but if the paddle wheels are turning over with speed, he seldom
worries over the possibilities which lie beneath him. His answer
to the question, whether the water is below the safety point,
comes as he feels the deck lifting beneath his feet, and he sails
away to leeward amid the debris of a wrecked steamboat.</p>

<p>Probably four-fifths of the boiler explosions which have taken
place on the Mississippi River during the last eighty years&mdash;and
there have been hundreds of such&mdash;were the result of these
conditions: low water in the boilers, exposing the plates until
red-hot, then throwing in water and "jumping" the steam pressure
faster than the engines or safety-valve could release it, followed
by the inevitable giving away of the whole fabric of the boiler,
wrecking the steamer, and usually killing and scalding many of
the passengers and crew.</p>

<p>On a side-wheel boat the make-up of the engine crew is
different. In addition to the first and second engineers there are
two "cubs", or "strikers". The stern-wheeler has two engines,
but they are both coupled to the same shaft, by a crank at each
end. The throttle wheel is in the centre of the boat. One man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
operates the two engines, and assists at landings, but in a bad
piece of river is helped by one of the firemen, who is called aft
by a little bell controlled by a cord from the engine-room. This
man "ships up" on the port side, while the engineer "ships up"
on the starboard. "Shipping up" was the term used to describe
the act of shifting the cam-rod from the lower pin on the reversing
lever to the upper, or <i>vice versa</i>. If done at a sudden call, the
engineer ran to one side and "shipped up", then across the deck
to the other, and then back to the centre to "give her steam".
That is all changed now by the adoption of an improved reversing
gear, similar to that on a railway locomotive, the throwing of a
lever at the centre of the boat operating the reversing gears on
both engines at once. Instead of the old-time "short-link", or "cut-off
hook", the equivalent of the "hooking-back" on a locomotive
when under way is performed by the engineer at the centre of the
boat by hooking back the reversing lever one, two, or three notches,
exactly as on the locomotive. Fifty years ago this simple device
had not been adopted on the river.</p>

<p>On the side-wheel boat, to get back to my subject, the engines
are independent&mdash;one engine to each wheel. One may be coming
ahead while the other is backing, or they may both be reversing
at the same time. A man is therefore required to operate each
engine, hence the necessity for a "striker", or "cub", to take one
engine while the engineer on watch takes the other. The engineer
on duty, be he chief or assistant, takes the starboard engine and
controls the running of the machinery and the feeding of the
boilers during his watch; the "cub" takes the port engine and
works under the direction of his superior on watch. As I have
stated at the beginning of this chapter, the handling of these
powerful engines was hard work, even for a grown man, when
the river was low and the pilot was feeling his way over a crossing
in a dark night, with both leads going, and the wheels doing much
of the work of keeping the boat in the intricate channel between
the reefs. Then it was that the bells came thick and fast&mdash;to
stop, to back, to come ahead again, to slow, to come ahead full
steam, and again to stop and back and come ahead. Then the
cut-off hook was pulled up by a rope attached to the deck beams
overhead, and the heavy cam-rod was lifted from the lower hook
to the upper by main strength, or dropped from the upper to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
lower with scant regard for the finish on the bright work, to be
lifted again at the call of the next bell from the pilot, and all
this a dozen times, or even more, in making one crossing.</p>

<p>And all the time the "cub" was in deadly fear of getting
his engine caught on the centre, a calamity in both material and
moral sense, as a "centre" might mean the disablement of an
engine at a critical moment, throwing the steamer out of the
channel, and hanging her up for hours, or even for days, on a sand-bar.
It might even have a more calamitous sequence, by running
her on the rocks or snags and sinking her. Hence, for pressing
reasons, the most acute alertness was necessary on the part of
the "striker". The moral obloquy of "centring" an engine was so
great among river men, especially among engineers, that no "cub"
ever again held his head high after suffering such a mischance;
and it was a proud boast among the embryo engineers if they
could honestly claim that they had never "centred" their engine.
On general principles they always boasted of it as a fact, until
some one appeared who could testify to the contrary. I enter
that claim here and now without fear of successful contradiction.
All my confederates in that business are now out of commission.</p>

<p>One of the beauties of the puppet-valve engine, with its long
stroke<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and consequent "purchase" on the shaft-crank, was that
by the aid of a billet of wood, about two and a half inches square,
with a handle whittled off on one end, and with a loop of cord to
hang it up by, or to hang it on one's wrist (where it was usually
found when the boat was navigating a crooked piece of river),
an increase of fifty per cent of steam could be let into the cylinder
by the simple device of inserting the club between the rocker-arm
and the lever which lifted the inlet valve, as graphically described
in the paper by Mr. Holloway, quoted in this chapter. If the
valve were normally lifted four inches by the rocker-arm, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
insertion of the club would increase the lift by its thickness.
This additional power fed to the cylinder at the right moment
would drive the wheel over the centre when reversed with the
boat going upstream at a speed of eight or ten miles an hour,
against a four-mile current, with almost absolute certainty. With
a ten-foot wheel, and three buckets in the water, one submerged
to its full width of three feet, and the other two perhaps two
feet, it can readily be understood by an engineer that to turn
such a wheel back against the current required a great expenditure
of power at just the right time. The "club" of the Western
steamboat engineer solved the question of additional power at
the critical moment. No short-stroke engine would respond to
such a call. While this service tried the cylinders to their utmost&mdash;many
times a little beyond their utmost, with a consequent loss
of a cylinder head, and worse yet, a scalded engineer&mdash;the use
of the club was justified by experience; and results which, with
finer and more perfect machinery would have been impossible,
were, day after day, made possible by reason of the crudeness and
roughness of this usage.</p>

<p>The great steamers plying on Long Island Sound attain a
speed of twenty miles an hour, or even more. It is said that
when under full speed it is possible to turn the wheels back over
the centre within half a mile after steam has been shut off. Under
ordinary conditions it is not necessary that they should be handled
any faster. But think of the conditions under which a Mississippi
River steamboat must stop and back, or suffer shipwreck. And
imagine, if you can, the remarks a river pilot would make if the
wheel were not turning back within thirty seconds after the bell
was rung. I think five seconds would be nearer the limit for
reversing and giving steam. In fact, on all side-wheel boats, the
levers controlling the steam valves are attached to small tackles,
and these are controlled by one lever, by which the steam levers
may be raised in an instant, without closing the throttle at all,
and the steam allowed to pass out through the escape pipes while
the engine remains passive.</p>

<p>Two ends are attained by this device: steam can instantly
be shut off, or as quickly given to the cylinders, thus making
a saving in time over the usual opening and closing of the steam
ports by the throttle wheel. Another advantage is, that this device
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
acts as a safety-valve; for, were the steam to be entirely shut
off, and the safety-valve fail to work, an explosion would certainly
follow. By opening all the valves at once, and permitting as much
steam to escape through the exhaust pipes as when the engine is
in motion, the danger of an explosion is minimized. At the call
of the pilot the levers can instantly be dropped and full steam
ahead or reversed given at once&mdash;of course at the expense of
a good deal of a "jolt" to the engines and cylinders. But the
river engines were built to be "jolted", hence their practical
adaptation to the service in which they were used.</p>

<p>J. F. Holloway, of St. Louis, who, in his own words, "was
raised on the river, having filled every position from roustabout
to master", in a paper read before the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers at St. Louis in May, 1896, contributes the
following description of a steamboat race as seen and heard in
the engine-room&mdash;a point of view somewhat lacking, perhaps,
in picturesqueness to the ordinary observer, but nevertheless very
essential in winning a race. The writer is evidently as thoroughly
at home in the engine-room as he is upon the roof:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p>"The reason which induced the builders of engines for these Western
river boats to adopt such peculiar construction could hardly be made clear
without a careful description of the hull of the boats, and of the varying
conditions to which both engines and hulls are subjected, and under which
they must operate. The steam cylinders are placed on foundations as
unstable as would be a raft, and the alignment is varied by the addition
or removal of every ton of freight which the boats carry when afloat, and
they are further distorted when aground, or when the boats are being
dragged over sand bars having several inches less of water on them than
is required to float the hull. While the calm study of the machinery of
a Western river steamboat while at rest would be an interesting object
lesson to any one at all interested in such matters, it can only be seen at its
best at a time when some rival boat is striving with it for "the broom,"
and close behind is slowly gaining, with roaring furnaces, and chimneys
belching out vast volumes of thick black smoke; when all on board, from
the pilot above to the fireman below are worked up to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm, and when engines, boilers, engineers and all concerned in
the management of the boat, are called upon to show the stuff which is
in them. I know of no more exciting scene than was often to be witnessed
in the days of the old famous Ohio River ports, when a "ten-boiler" boat
was trying to make a record, or take a wharf-boat landing away from
some close-following rival steamer. To stand on the boiler deck at such
a time on a big side-wheel boat, when in order to get ahead the pilot had
made up his mind to close-shave a "tow-head," or take the dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
chances of a new channel or a new "cut-off," and when all on board knew
the risk he was taking, and standing by to help him through, or help
<i>themselves</i> if he failed, was exciting to a degree. Then it was that the
two most skilful and daring engineers were called on watch, and took
their stands alongside their respective engines, stripped like gladiators for
the tussle which soon came as the clanging starboard bell rang out to
"slow down," and as the hasty ringing of the "jingler" over the port
engine meant "crack it to her." Then as the bow of the big boat swung,
all too slow to suit the emergency or the impatience of the pilot, a stopping
starboard bell would ring, quick followed by a backing one which would
set the engineer to wrestling with his "hooks," one of which he hangs
up with a cord, and the other he picks up seemingly from somewhere on
the platform. As the suddenly stopped and quivering wheel in the swift-flowing
current hangs for a moment poised on the centre, the engineer,
grasping his ever-at-hand club of wood, quickly thrusts it between the
uprising rocker-arm and the lever that lifts the inlet puppet valve, to
which widened opening of the steam-valve port the engine responds with
a noise of escaping steam not unlike the roar of an enraged elephant
when prodded with the iron hook of his keeper. The battle of the bells
thus begun, waxes more fierce as the excitement increases. There are bells
to the right, and bells to the left, and amid their discordant jangle the
engineers are working like mad as they clutch the throttle, open or close
"the bleeder," hook her on "ahead," or stop and back, in such rapid
succession as that soon neither they, nor any one else, can tell how far
behind the bells of the pilot they are. Then soon amid the wild roar of
the pent-up steam as it rushes out of the safety-valve pipes, the exploding
exhausts of the engines which at the end of each stroke sound as if the
cylinder-head had blown off, and to which is added the shrill noise of the
warning bell which calls to the firemen to "throw open the furnace doors,"
there comes from out the huge trumpet shaped pipe above the head of the
engineers, and which leads down from the pilot-house, a hoarse shout,
heard above all else, partaking alike of command, entreaty, and adjectives,
urging something or other to be done, and done quick, else the boat and
all on board of her, in a brief time will land in a place which by reason
of the reputed entire absence of water could not well be called a "port"
(and certainly is no port mentioned in the boat's manifests). This battle
of the bells and irons goes on until, if in a race, the rival boat is passed
or crowded to the bank, or the narrow channel widens out into the broad
river, when the discordant jangle of the bells ceases, the tired engineer
drops on the quiet "cut-off hook," lays by his emergency wooden club, and
wiping the sweat from his heated brow, comes down from the foot-board
to catch a breath of the cool air which sweeps over the guards, and to
formulate in his mind the story which he will have to tell of the race just
over, or the perils just past.</p>

<p>But the old-time flyers which before the war tore their way up and
down through the muddy waters of these Western rivers are all gone,
and the marvelously skilled pilots of those days have gone too; the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
who, through the darkest hours of the darkest nights, knew to within a
few feet just where their boats were, and what was on the right or on the
left, or beneath them, which was to be shunned. The engineers too, who
with a courage born and nurtured amid the vicissitudes of a backwoods
life, and with an experience and skill the outgrowth of trials and dangers
gone through, have also passed away, and to the generation of the present
are unhonored and unknown, as are the men who designed and built the
hulls, and the workmen who, with crude and scant tools, built for them
the machinery which they so well planned and handled.</p>

<p>Who they were, and where they lie, is known to but few, if any.
Did I but know their final resting-place, I would, like "Old Mortality,"
wish to carve anew, and deep, the fading records of their life and death,
which time has so nearly obliterated, and to herald abroad the praise and
honor due them as the designers, builders, and engineers, of the old-time
Western river steamboats."</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_5"></a>Chapter V<br />
<i>The Engineer</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It would be impossible to pick out any one man who handled
an engine on the river fifty years ago, and in describing his
habits and peculiarities claim him as a type of all river engineers
of his time. The legendary engineer, such as Colonel Hay has
given us, standing at the throttle of his engine on the ill-fated
"Prairie Belle", waiting for signals from the pilot house, his boat
a roaring furnace of fire, and whose spirit finally ascended with
the smoke of his steamer, was a true type of one class, and
possibly a large class, of old-time river engineers. Reckless, profane,
combative; yet courageous, proud of their calling, and to
be depended upon to do their duty under any and all circumstances;
giving, if need be, their lives for the safety of the
passengers and crew of the boat&mdash;such was one class. Another
was composed of men equally courageous, equally to be depended
upon in time of danger, but sober, quiet, religious, family men,
who never used a profane word, never went on sprees ashore,
never supported one wife at home and another at "Natchez under
the Hill."</p>

<p>On the boat upon which I gained the greater part of my
river experience, we had the two types: George McDonald, chief,
and Billy Hamilton, assistant. Either would have died at his
post, the one with a prayer upon his lips, and the other with a
jest; both alike alert, cool, efficient. McDonald was a Scotch
Presbyterian, and might have been an elder in the church at
home&mdash;perhaps he was. He was a religious man on board his
boat, where religion was at a discount. He was a capable engineer;
he could make anything that it was possible to make, on the
portable forge in the steamer's smithy. He was always cool,
deliberate, ready, and as chief was the captain's right-hand man
in the engine-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Billy Hamilton was his opposite in everything, save in professional
qualifications. In these he was the equal of his chief,
except in length of service, and consequent experience. The son
of a Maryland slave owner, he was a "wild one" on shore, and
a terror to the captain when on board and on duty. In a race
with a rival boat his recklessness in carrying steam was always
counted upon by the pilot on watch, to make up for any inherent
difference in speed that might handicap our boat. He would put
on the blower (forced draft) until solid chunks of live wood
coals would be blown from the smokestacks. He would keep
the water at the first gauge, or under it. He had a line rigged
from the safety-valve lever, running aft to the engine-room. In
times of peace the line was rove over a pulley fixed under the
deck, above the safety-valve. A pull on the line in this position
would raise the valve and allow the steam to escape. When
another boat was in sight, going our way, the slack of the rope
was hauled forward and the bight carried under a pulley fixed
in a stanchion alongside the boiler, below the safety-valve, running
thence up and over the upper pulley as before&mdash;but with all the
difference in the world, for with the fifty-pound anvil hanging
to the end of the line thus reversed in its leverage, the boilers
might have blown up a hundred times before the safety-valve
would have acted.</p>

<p>I have often heard the signal which Billy had agreed upon
with his fireman on the port side, and have seen the darky slip
the line under the lower pulley, and then keep one eye on the
boiler-deck companionway, watching for the captain. Should he
be seen coming below, the line was as quickly slipped off the lower
pulley and restored to its normal position; sometimes with a concurrent
"blowing off" through the safety-valve, which was evidence
enough for the captain, although he might not catch Billy in the
act. It is no more than just to say that the visits of the captain
below decks were not frequent. He was a New Orleans man, of
French extraction, with a fine sense of honor which forbade any
espionage of this nature, unless there seemed to be an especially
flagrant case of steam-carrying on the part of his junior engineer.</p>

<p>Billy had another device which greatly galled the captain,
and later it was the cause of a serious affair. The captain
had a private servitor, a colored man who cared for his rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
in the "Texas", served his lunches there, and ran errands about
the boat as required. The captain used to send him down to the
engine-room when he suspected Hamilton was carrying more
steam than was nominated in the license, to look at the gauge
and take readings.</p>

<p>It was not long before Hamilton became aware of this
surreptitious reading, and set himself to work to defeat it without
the necessity of ordering the captain's man out of the engine-room.
To this end he made a cap of sheet lead which covered
the face of the dial, leaving only about two inches in the centre,
showing the pivot and a small portion of the pointer. This
balked the colored messenger completely, as he could not see the
figures, and he was not well enough acquainted with the instrument
to read it from the centre. On his last visit to the engine-room,
Hamilton saw him coming. Pretending that he was going
forward to try the water, but keeping his eye on the messenger,
he saw him reach up and take off the cap. In an instant Hamilton
turned and threw his shaping hammer, which he had in his
hand, with such true aim that it struck the poor darky in the
head and knocked him senseless. As he dropped to the deck
Hamilton called one of his firemen, telling him to give his
compliments to Captain Faucette and tell him to send some men
and take away his (profanely described) nigger, as he had no
use for him. The darky pulled through all right, I think.
He was put ashore at the first landing and placed under the care
of a doctor, and Hamilton paid his bills. His successor never
came into the engine-room, and the cap on the steam gauge was
laid aside as unnecessary.</p>

<p>Whenever the mate had a "shindy" with the crew, which
was composed of forty Irishmen, all the other officers of the boat
were bound to "stand by" for trouble. Hamilton was always
ready, if not anxious, for such occasions, and he and Billy Wilson,
the mate, always supported each other so effectively that many an
incipient mutiny was quickly quelled, the two jumping into a
crowd and hitting every head in sight with whatever weapon
happened to be at hand until order was restored. Usually, however,
it was with bare hands, and the show which authority always
makes in face of insubordination.</p>

<p>At times, Billy's vagaries were of a grisly and gruesome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
character. I recall that at Point Douglass, on one of our trips,
we found a "floater" (body of a drowned man) that had been
in the water until it was impossible to handle it. To get it on
shore it was necessary to slide a board beneath, and draw out
board and body together. It was a malodorous and ghastly undertaking.
Something said to this effect, Hamilton laughed at as
being altogether too finicky for steamboatmen. To demonstrate
that it need not affect either one's sensibilities or stomach, he
stepped into the cook's galley for a sandwich, and sitting down on
the end of the board, alongside the corpse, ate his lunch without
a qualm.</p>

<p>Another and rather more amusing incident took place while
the "Fanny Harris" was in winter quarters at Prescott. The
night before St. Patrick's day, Billy made up an effigy, which he
hung between the smokestacks. As the manikin had a clay pipe
in its mouth and a string of potatoes about its neck, it might have
reference to the patron saint of the Old Sod. The loyal Irishmen
of the town so interpreted it at least, and Billy had to stand
off the crowd for several hours with a shot gun, and finally get
the town marshal to guard the boat while he climbed up and
removed the obnoxious image.</p>

<p>He had a little iron cannon which he fired on all holidays,
and sometimes when there was no holiday; in the latter case, at
about three o'clock in the morning, just to remind people living
in the vicinity of the levee that he was still "on watch". In
retaliation for the effigy affair, his Irish friends slipped aboard the
boat one evening while he was away and spiked his cannon by driving
a rat-tail file into the vent; this was after he had carefully loaded
it for a demonstration intended to come off the next morning.
He discovered the trick when he attempted to fire the gun, and
offered pertinent and forcible remarks, but unprintable in this
narration. He lost no time in vain regrets, however. Lighting
up his forge he made a screw and drew out the load. Then with
the help of several chums he moved his forge to the bow of the
boat (the foc'sle), rigged a crane so that he could swing his
little cannon in a chain sling, from the capstan to the forge,
and back again. When the time came for firing the salute he
had his gun heated red-hot on the forge; it was then swung back
on to the capstan-head, where it was lashed with a chain. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
bucket of water was then thrown into the gun, and instantly a
hardwood plug, made to fit, was driven home with his heavy
striking hammer. In a minute the steam generated by this process
caused an explosion that threw the plug almost across the river,
fully a quarter of a mile, with a reasonably fair result in the way
of noise. It was a risky piece of work, but "Billy" was in his
element when there was a spice of risk mixed with his sports.</p>

<p>Billy's humor was broad, but never malicious. He never
missed an opportunity to play a practical joke on any one, save,
perhaps, the captain himself. The deck hands who "soldiered"
by sitting on the side of their bunks when they ought to be at
work toting freight, were sometimes lifted several feet in the
air by the insertion of two inches of a darning needle ingeniously
attached to the under side of the board bench upon which they
took their seat. It was operated from the engine-room by a fine
wire and a stiff spring, the whole boxed in so securely by the
carpenter that there was no possibility of its discovery by the
enraged victim.</p>

<p>He was one of the most open-handed and liberal of men
in his givings, and in spite of his escapades a valuable officer. In
1862 he left the boat, as did all the crew, to enlist under the
call for three hundred thousand troops, made in July of that
year. In all discussions of the war he had asserted his determination
to keep away from any place where there was shooting,
as he was afraid of bullets of any size from an ounce up. As
he was a Southern man, son of a slaveholder, we thought that
this badinage was to cover his determination not to take any
part in the war on the Union side; we never questioned his
courage. He went into the navy as an acting assistant engineer,
and was assigned to one of the "tin-clads" that Commodore
Porter had improvised for service on the Mississippi and tributaries,
and that did such heroic service in opening and keeping
open the great river. Within a few months after his entry into
the service, his old friends saw with pleasure, but not surprise,
his name mentioned in general orders for gallantry in action.
He had stood by his engine on the gunboat after a pipe had been
cut by a shell from a Confederate shore battery, a number of men
being killed and wounded, and the engine-room filled with escaping
steam. Binding his coat over his face and mouth to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
inhalation of the steam he handled his engines at the risk of his
life, in response to the pilot's bells, until his boat was withdrawn
from danger. It was in keeping with his known character; and
his talk of being "afraid of guns" was only a part of the levity
with which he treated all situations, grave or gay.</p>

<p>I do not know Billy's ultimate fate. When he left the
"Fanny Harris" for gunboat service, I also left to enlist in the
infantry. After three years in the army I was mustered out in
Washington, and soon went to New York where I remained for
ten years or more. In the interim between 1862 and 1876, when
I returned to the West, I completely lost sight of all my old
river acquaintances. When, later, I made inquiries of those whom
I did find, they either did not enlighten me as to his fate, or, if
they did, I made so little note of it that it has escaped my memory.</p>

<i>The "Mud" Clerk</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;<i>Comparative Honors</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The transition from the "main deck" to the "boiler deck"
marked an era in my experience. It opened a new chapter in
my river life, and one from which I have greatly profited. When
I went upon the river I was about as bashful a boy as could
be found; that had been my failing from infancy. As pantry boy
I had little intercourse with the passengers, the duties of that
department of river industry requiring only the washing, wiping,
and general care of dishes and silverware. A "cub" engineer
slipped up to his stateroom, and donned presentable clothing in
which to eat his meals in the forward cabin, at the officers' table,
where all save the captain and chief clerk took their meals. After
that, his principal business was to keep out of sight as much as
possible until it was time to "turn in". He was not an officer,
and passengers were not striving for his acquaintance.</p>

<p>As second clerk all these conditions were changed. In the
absence of the chief clerk, his assistant took charge of the office,
answered all questions of passengers, issued tickets for passage
and staterooms, showed people about the boat, and in a hundred
ways made himself agreeable, and so far as possible ministered to
their comfort and happiness while on board. The reputation of
a passenger boat depended greatly upon the esteem in which the
captain, clerks, and pilots were held by the travelling public. The
fame of such a crew was passed along from one tourist to
another, until the gentle accomplishments of a boat's <i>personnel</i>
were as well known as their official qualifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Captain William Faucette was, as I have said, of French
Creole stock, from New Orleans. In addition to being a good
and capable officer on the roof, he was also highly endowed with
the graces that commended him to the ladies and gentlemen who
took passage with him. Polite in his address, a fine dancer, a
good story-teller and conversationist, his personality went far
toward attracting the public who travelled for pleasure&mdash;and
that was the best-paying traffic, for which every first-class packet
was bidding.</p>

<p>Charles Hargus, chief clerk, was not far behind his chief in
winning qualities. An educated man, he was also possessed of the
address and the other personal qualities which were necessary
to equip one for becoming a successful officer on a Mississippi
passenger steamer.</p>

<p>Such was the atmosphere into which the oily "cub" from the
engine-room was ushered, when drafted into this service because
of the serious illness of the second clerk. It was too late to get
a man from the city, and the necessities of the case required an
immediate filling of the vacancy. I was invited, or rather commanded,
to go into the office for the trip, and do what I could
to help out with the work until the return to Galena, where a
man or boy could be found to fill the office until the sick officer
returned.</p>

<p>The boat was guard-deep with freight, and at night the
cabin was carpeted with passengers sleeping on mattresses spread
on the floor. The chief clerk simply had to have somebody to
help out. On my part, it was the chance of my life. Without
much prior business experience, what little I had was right in
line. I had checked freight on the levee for the firm of L. H.
Merrick &amp; Co., was a good penman, fairly good at figures, and
had made out freight bills in the transfer of freight at Prescott,
which fact was known to the chief clerk. It is needless to add
that I required no second order. While second clerks were not
likely to get any shore leave at either end of the route, nor at any
intermediate ports, it required no brilliancy of intellect to see that
checking freight was comparatively cleaner than, and superlatively
preferable to, boiler-scaling.</p>

<p>Regarding my success in this new field, suffice it to say that
the trip to St. Paul and return was made, and the freight checked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
out with surprisingly few errors for a beginner. The cargo of
wheat, potatoes, etc., was correctly counted in, properly entered
in the books, and correctly checked out at Prairie du Chien and
Dunleith. The sick clerk did not rejoin the boat. The temporary
appointment by the captain and chief clerk was made permanent
by the secretary of the company at Dunleith, Mr. Blanchard, on
the recommendation of Mr. Hargus, my chief. We ran into
Galena on our regular Thursday afternoon time, and instead of
creeping into a steaming, muddy boiler, I walked out on to the
levee and was introduced to the great wholesalers who at that time
made Galena their headquarters, as "Mr. Merrick, our new second
clerk", and the work of loading for a new trip was taken up.</p>

<p>While the office of second clerk was a decided promotion from
my point of view, it was not so esteemed on the river. Leaving
the engine-room was leaving the opportunity to learn the profession
of engineering. Once learned, it was then assumed that the
person so equipped was guaranteed employment so long as he
willed, with a minimum amount of competition. Later developments
revealed the fallacy of this conception. Within ten years
thereafter, steamboating was practically dead on the upper Mississippi.
The completion of one or more railroads into St. Paul,
ended the river monopoly. Thereafter a dozen steamboats did
the business formerly requiring a hundred. The wages of engineers
and pilots dropped to a figure undreamed of in the flush
times between 1850 and 1860; there were twenty men competing
for every berth upon the river.</p>

<p>My new berth was not silk-lined, however. There was an
aristocracy in the official family above decks. The captain and
the chief clerk represented the first class, and the mate and the
second clerk the other. The line between these was represented
by the watches into which all officers on the boat were divided for
rounds of duty. The captain and his mate, and the chief clerk
and his second stood watch and watch during the twenty-four hours
(that is, six hours on and six hours off) all the season. The pilots
and engineers interposed a "dog watch", to break the monotony.
The captain and the chief clerk went on watch after breakfast, at
seven in the morning, and stood until noon. At twelve o'clock they
were relieved by the mate and the second clerk, who ran the steamboat
and the business until six o'clock in the evening, when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
were relieved. After supper, they turned in until midnight, when
they were called and relieved the captain and the chief clerk, who
retired and slept until morning. While each class of officers was
on duty the same number of hours each day, the difference lay in
the fact that the junior officers were compelled by this arrangement
to turn out at midnight throughout the season. It was this turning
out at midnight that made the mate's watch (the port watch)
very undesirable so far as personal ease and comfort was concerned.
A man can knock about until midnight very agreeably, after a short
nap in the afternoon, provided he can have a sound sleep during
the "dead hours" from midnight until six o'clock in the morning.
To turn out at midnight every night and work until six is an
entirely different matter.</p>

<p>The pilots and engineers on our boat&mdash;and so far as my
experience went, on all boats&mdash;stood a "dog-watch" from four
in the morning until seven, thus making five watches during the
twenty-four hours, bringing the men of the two watches on duty
alternately at midnight, and shortening the "dead hours" from
midnight to four o'clock, and from four until seven, so that one
did not get so "dead" tired and sleepy as he would in standing a
watch beginning every night at midnight.</p>

<p>It was believed on the river that more people die between
midnight and morning than during any other six hours in the
twenty-four. I think that I have heard physicians confirm this.
My own experience in going on watch at midnight continuously
during six months is, that there is less vitality and ambition available
in that period than in any other. In fact, I have no distinct
recollection that there was any ambition at all mixed up in the
process of writing up delivery books, checking out freight, measuring
wood, and performing the hundred other duties that fell to
the lot of the officer on watch, when done in the depressing atmosphere
of early morning. It was a matter of duty, unmixed with
higher motives.</p>

<p>It was not only the turning out at unholy hours, that differentiated
between first and second clerk. The second clerk must have
his delivery book written up for all the landings to be made during
his off-watch. The chief clerk then made the delivery from the
book, upon which the receipts were taken. If, during the second
clerk's off-watch, there was a particularly large manifest for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
landing, the assistant was called to attend to the delivery, after
which he could turn in again, if he chose. Of course it took a
river man but a moment to go to sleep after touching his bunk;
but his rest was broken, and in the course of the season this began
to tell on every one. Under the stress of it, men became hollow-eyed
and lost flesh and strength.</p>

<p>When on watch, the second clerk not only attended to his
own particular duties, but he also assumed for the time those of
the chief clerk. He collected fares from passengers coming aboard
during his watch; assigned rooms, provided there were any left to
assign, or a mattress on the cabin floor if there chanced to be any
space left on the floor, whereon to place another mattress; collected
freight bills, paid for wood or coal, and performed any other duties
ordinarily performed by the chief clerk when on watch. It was
not considered good form to call the chief clerk during his off-watch;
in fact, to do so would be a confession of ignorance or
inability, which no self-respecting second clerk cared to exhibit, and
but rarely did. Many the close conference with the chief mate, his
companion as well as superior during the long night watches; and
many the smiles evoked in after days when recalling the well-meant
but somewhat impracticable advice tendered upon some such occasions
by the good-hearted autocrat of the "roof" and fo' castle.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_7"></a>Chapter VII<br />
<i>Wooding Up</i></h2>
</div>

<p>As second clerk, I was early taught to hold my own with the
pirates who conducted the woodyards scattered along the river,
from which the greater part of the fuel used on old-time river
boats was purchased. There was a great variety of wood offered
for sale, and a greater diversity in the manner of piling it. It was
usually ranked eight feet high, with a "cob-house" at each end of
the rank. It was the rule on the river to measure but one of the
end piles, if the whole rank was taken, or one-half of one end pile
if but a part of the rank was bought. For convenience, the woodmen
usually put twenty cords in a rank, and allowed enough to
cover the shortage caused by cross-piling at the ends. Being piled
eight feet high, ten lengths of the measuring stick (eight feet
long) equalled twenty cords, if it were fairly piled. Woodmen
who cared for their reputation and avoided a "scrap" with the
clerks, captains, and mates of steamboats, usually made their
twenty-cord ranks eighty-four feet long and eight feet high. Such
dealers also piled their sticks parallel to each other in the ranks;
they also threw out the rotten and very crooked ones. When the
clerk looked over such a tier, after having run his stick over it,
he simply invited the owner aboard and paid him his fifty or sixty
dollars, according to the quality of the wood, took him across the
cabin to the bar, and invited him to "have one on the boat", shook
hands, and bade him good night.</p>

<p>It took the "pirates" to start the music, however. When only
scant eighty feet were found in the rank, with rotten and green
wood sandwiched in, all through the tiers, and crooked limbs and
crossed sticks in all directions, it became the duty of the clerk to
estimate his discount. After running his rod over it, he would
announce, before the first stick was taken off by the deck hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the amount of wood in the rank&mdash;nineteen and a half cords,
nineteen cords, eighteen and a half cords, or in extreme cases only
eighteen. When the mate could stand behind the rank and see,
through a cross-piled hole, more than half the length of the steamboat,
it was deemed a rather acute case, calling for the eighteen-cord
decision. When this decision was made and announced, it
was, on our boat at least, always adhered to. We always took
wood some time before our visible supply was exhausted, in order
to meet just such emergencies. The owner might, and usually did,
damn everybody and everything connected with the craft in the
most lurid terms. But the one question he had to answer, and
answer quickly, was: "Will you take it?" If "No", the bell was
struck and the boat backed off, while the woodman and roustabouts
exchanged a blue-streaked volley of vituperation. If, on the other
hand, a sale was made, the owner usually took his money and the
inevitable drink at the bar, and then went down to the main deck
and had it out with the mate, who was always a match, and more
than a match, for any merely local and provincial orator. His
vocabulary was enriched with contributions from all ports between
St. Louis and St. Paul, while that of the squatter was lacking in
the elements of diversity necessary to give depth and breadth to
the discussion.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to class all woodyard men with squatters
like the foregoing specimens, of whom there were hundreds scattered
along the islands and lowlands bordering the river, cutting
wood on government land, and moving along whenever the federal
officers got on their trail. On the mainland were many settlers,
opening up farms along the river, and the chance to realize ready
money from the sale of wood was not to be neglected. In many
places chutes had been built of heavy planks, descending from the
top of the bluff, from one to two hundred feet above the river.
The upland oak, cut into four-foot lengths, was shot down to the
water's edge, where a level space was found to rank it up. These
men were honest, almost without exception, and their wood always
measured true. The upland wood was vastly superior to the
lowland growth; steamboat captains not only paid the highest price
for it, but further endeavored to contract for all the wood at
certain yards. I remember one, run by a Mr. Smith, between
Prescott and Diamond Bluff, and another near Clayton, Iowa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
that always furnished the best dry oak wood, and gave full
measure.</p>

<p>It was at the latter place that I nearly lost my berth, through
a difference with the "Old Man"&mdash;the captain. I had measured
the rank and announced the amount of wood as twenty cords.
The captain was on deck at the time, and watching the measurement.
When the announcement was made he ordered the wood
remeasured. I went over it carefully, measuring from the centre
of the cross-pile at one end to the centre of the cross-pile at the
other end of the rank, and again reported "twenty cords". Captain
Faucette called down to "measure it again", with an inflection
plainly intimating that I was to discount it, adding, "You measured
both ends." The rank was full height, closely piled, and
the best of split white oak, and I had already taken out one of the
ends; further, I had already twice reported twenty cords in the
hearing of all the crew and many passengers, who were now
giving their undivided attention to this affair. I therefore did not
feel like stultifying myself for the sake of stealing a cord or two
of wood, and replied that I had already measured it twice, and
that I had not measured both ends of the rank. The "Old Man"
flew into a rage and ordered me to go to the office and get my
money, and he would find a man who knew how to measure wood.
There being nothing for it but to obey an order of this kind, I
went aboard, hung up my measuring stick in its beckets, and
reported at the office for my money. Mr. Hargus, my chief, was
astonished, and asked for an explanation, which I gave him. He
rushed out to the woodpile with the rod, ran over it in a flash,
and reported to the captain on the roof, "Twenty cords, sir!" and
came back to the office. He told me to go on with my work and
say nothing, which I was ready enough to do. In the meantime,
the crew were toting the wood aboard.</p>

<p>When the boat backed off, the captain sent for Mr. Hargus
to meet him in his private room in the "Texas", where they had
it out in approved style. Hargus only replied to Captain Faucette
that if Merrick was discharged he would also take his pay and
go ashore with him. Faucette was a new man in the line, from
the far South, and a comparative stranger, while Hargus was a
veteran with the company, a stockholder in the line, and backed
by all the Dubuque stockholders, as well as by the officers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
directors of the company; so the captain thought better of it and
dropped the whole matter, never deigning to speak to the second
clerk, either in way of apology, which was not expected, or of
caution "not to let it occur again", which would have been an
insult. The affair was "dropped overboard", as Hargus said,
and the wood-measuring was thereafter left to the proper officer,
without comment or interference.</p>

<p>With a crew of forty men looking on and hearing the whole
colloquy, a change in the amount of wood reported at the suggestion
of the captain, would have simply wiped out any respect
they may have had for the authority of the boy officer; and his
usefulness on that boat, if not on the river, would have ended then
and there. It was one of the unwritten rules of the service that
the officers were to stand by each other in every way; there was
to be no interference while on duty, and each was held responsible
for such duty. If there was cause for reprimand it was to be
administered in the privacy of the captain's office, and not in the
presence of the whole crew. It was not desirable to have either
office or officer held in contempt.</p>

<p>As the steamboat business developed, and as immigration into
the new Territory of Minnesota increased, there was necessity for
getting as many trips into a season as possible. This led to the
adoption of every device that might lessen the running time of
steamers between the lower ports and St. Paul. Not the least
of these innovations was the use of the wood-boat for the more
ready transfer of fuel from the bank to the deck of the steamer.
Flatboats, or scows, capable of carrying twenty cords of wood,
and even forty, were loaded at the woodyards in readiness for the
expected steamer. As the wood was worth more loaded in the
scow, a higher price was given by steamboatmen, and contracts
were made ahead; the date of arrival of the boat was determined,
and the wood-boat was in readiness, day or night, with two men
on board. It was the work of a few minutes only to run alongside,
make fast the towlines, and while the steamer was on her way up
river, thirty or forty men pitched or carried the wood aboard.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the wood-boat was not in tow more than half an
hour, which would take her five or six miles up river. When the
wood was out, the towlines were cast off, a large sweep or steering
oar was shipped up at each end of the scow, and it drifted back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
to be reloaded for the next customer. The steamboat, meanwhile,
had lost practically no time in wooding, as the tow was so light
as but slightly to impede her speed. The greatest danger in the
transaction was that the great packet might swamp the scow by
running at too great speed, towing her under by the head, as sometimes
occurred. To avoid this contingency the wood was always
taken first from the bow of the flatboat. As it was only the fast
packets that patronized the wood-boats, this danger of towing under
was always present, and the pilots were always very careful in the
handling of their boats at such times. Flats were seldom towed
downstream, for the reason that there was no way of getting them
back, except to pay for a tow. And again, the packets were not
in so much of a hurry when going down river, for then they had
but few passengers to feed, and no fast freight.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_8"></a>Chapter VIII<br />
<i>The Mate</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In writing of life on the main deck of a Mississippi River
steamboat fifty years ago, a prefatory note may be in order. The
reader must bear in mind that times have changed; and men, in
the mass, have changed, and that for the better, in the years that
have elapsed between 1860 and 1908. Slavery then held sway
on the west bank of the river, from the Iowa line to the Gulf.
On the east side in the State of Illinois even, the slavery idea
predominated; and on the river there was no "other side" to the
question. Slavery was an "institution", as much to be observed and
venerated as any institution of the country. A black man was a
"nigger", and nothing more. If he were the personal property
of a white man in St. Louis, or below, he was worth from eight
hundred to fifteen hundred dollars, and was therefore too valuable
to be utilized in the make-up of a boat's crew running north.
The inclemency of the weather, or the strenuousness of the mate,
might result in serious physical deterioration that would greatly
depreciate him as a chattel, to say nothing of the opportunities
offered him by the northern trip to escape to Canada, and thus
prove a total loss.</p>

<p>Of free negroes there were not enough to man the hundreds
of steamboats plying on the upper river. Thus it came about
that the cabin crews on some boats, and the firemen on others, were
colored, while the deck crews (roustabouts and stevedores) were
white. So marked was this division of labor that it came to pass
that no "nigger" was permitted by the white rousters to handle
any freight, on any boat. The modern unions take no greater
exception to a non-union workman than the white deck hands
then expressed for a "nigger" as a freight handler.</p>

<p>Another class distinction was, that nine-tenths of the deck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
crew were Irishmen. In that day the poorer sort of that nationality
were the burden-bearers of this country. They dug the
ditches, built the railroad embankments, and toted the freight on
the river. Since that time they have wonderfully developed; in
the present day, very few even of the emigrants handle pick and
shovel, and none handle freight as river deck hands. They are
the trainmen and policemen of the country, and their sons are our
mayors and aldermen, our judges and law-makers. The dirt-handling
on the railroads is passed on to the Italians and the Huns,
while the river freight-handling, what little there is of it, is done
by the lower class of negroes. The abolition of slavery has
prodigiously increased their numbers, as well as amazingly cheapening
them in value. All this has relevancy in describing an
old-time mate and his work.</p>

<p>There was a fellow feeling between the chief mate and the
second clerk. For one thing, they were both in the second rank,
officially, although that did not count for a great deal, I think,
as neither of them thought of it in just that way. My recollection
is, that both of them thought of it from the other point of view&mdash;they
were over so many men, and in command of so many
things and situations, rather than under the captain and the chief
clerk. You will observe at once that this put an entirely different
construction upon the question; and this was, after all, the only
reasonable and practical view to take of it, and the one that came
nearest to meeting all the conditions. In fact, no other view of the
situation could be taken. When the captain and the chief clerk
were off duty and asleep in their staterooms, or even off duty and
awake, loitering about the boat, the responsibility was immediately
shifted to their subordinates. Even though the captain might be
sitting in the door of his room in the forward end of the "Texas",
while the mate stood at the bell to make a landing, the amenities
and traditions of river life put him out of the game as completely
as though he were asleep in his berth. The same also was true
of the chief clerk and his subordinate. The chief might be smoking
his after-dinner cigar within ten feet of the office, or he might
walk out on the levee and talk with the agent; but until asked,
he never took any part in the distinctive business transactions of
his subordinate, or in any way interfered with his manner of transacting
the business. He might, later, if necessary, make suggestions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
looking to the betterment of the methods of his second; but
that would be a purely personal, rather than an official, utterance.</p>

<p>It followed, therefore, that my acquaintance with Billy Wilson
was much closer than with the captain; and standing watch with
him day after day and night after night during a long season's
run, I came to know him intimately. He was born in Pennsylvania,
the son of a "Pennsylvania Dutchman." Beginning his
professional life on the Allegheny River, he worked down the
Ohio, and when the great boom in upper Mississippi traffic began
in 1854, engaged in that trade. A smooth-shaven, red-faced man,
about five feet eight inches in height, he weighed probably a
hundred and sixty pounds. Occasionally he took a drink of
whiskey, as did all river men, but it was seldom. He was well
read, and ordinarily, a very quiet man, therefore all the more to
be feared and respected. He would hardly fill the bill as a
traditional Mississippi River steamboat mate; and were his prototype
shown on the stage it would be voted slow, uninteresting,
and untrue to type.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this chapter I endeavored to indicate what
manner of men composed our deck crew. Ours numbered forty
men. Almost without exception they were Irishmen of the lowest
class, picked up alongshore at St. Louis, Galena, Dubuque, and
St. Paul, from the riffraff of the levee. They would get drunk
whenever they could get whiskey; and as the boat carried hundreds
of barrels of this liquor each trip, it required eternal vigilance on
the part of the mates and watchmen to prevent the crew broaching
a barrel and getting fighting drunk and mutinous. When this
happened, as now and then it did in spite of all precautions, Billy
Wilson was turned in an instant from a quiet Pennsylvania Dutchman
into a dangerous, if not devilish, driver. He carried, on
most occasions, a paddle made from a pork barrel stave. This had
a handle at one end, and the other, shaped something like a canoe
paddle, was bored full of quarter-inch holes. When the case was
one of mere sluggishness on the part of one of the hands, a light
tap with the flat part of this instrument was enough to inspire
activity. When the case was one of moroseness or incipient
mutiny, the same flat side, applied by his powerful muscles, with
a quick, sharp stroke, would leave a blood-blister for every hole
in the paddle; and when a drunken riot was to be dealt with, the
sharp edge of the paddle on a man's head left nothing more to be
done with that man until he "came to." With a revolver in his
left hand and his paddle in his right, he would jump into the
middle of a gang of drunken, mutinous men, and striking right
and left would intimidate or disable the crowd in less time than
it takes to tell it. He never used his pistol, and to my knowledge
never called for assistance, although that was ready if required,
for all officers were usually at hand and ready in case of necessity.</p>

In a row that took place at Prairie du Chien one night, when
the men had sent up town and smuggled in a jug of whiskey, one
man who was hit on the head by the paddle went overboard on the
upstream side of the boat. He was instantly sucked under by the
swift current, and was never seen again. The coroner's jury in
the case brought in a verdict of "accidental death", and Wilson
came back to work after a week's sojourn with the sheriff, having
won an added prestige that rendered less necessary the use of the
paddle.</p>

<p>Ordinarily his commands were given in a low tone of voice,
unaccompanied with the profanity which legend and story considered
due from the man and his office. When things went
wrong, however, the wide range and profundity of his language
was a revelation to the passengers who might chance to be within
ear-shot. I recall an outbreak, one April morning at about four
o'clock, at a woodyard, between Trempealeau and Winona. He
had called, "All hands, wood up!" It was a cold and rainy night,
and many of the men had crawled in under the boilers to dry their
clothes and seek sleep. After the first round or two, he found
that ten or fifteen men were missing&mdash;they were "soldiering."
He went aft and ransacked the bunks without finding the truants.
He then dove under the boilers with his paddle, striking in the
dark, and feeling for some one to hit, at the same time pouring out
a torrent of profanity that in ordinary walks of life, would be
called monumental, but which in the more exacting conditions of
river life, probably was not above medium grade. The next count
found every man in line, toting his share of the wood.</p>

<p>It may be and was asked by Eastern people, unused to river
life, "Why do the men submit to such treatment? Why do they
not throw the mate into the river?" The answer is, caste. They
were used to being driven, and expected nothing else, and nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
better, and they would not work under any other form of authority.
As I stated at the beginning, they were of the very lowest class.
No self-respecting man would ship as a deck hand under the then
existing conditions. One might now travel long and look in vain
for a white crew driven as these men then were. Their places
have been taken by the freed negro; he to-day is being driven as
his white predecessors were then.</p>

<p>There is this distinction, however; now, most of the drivers
are Irishmen&mdash;the mates and watchmen on the river steamers.
Then an Irishman was of little service as a mate. Those officers
were, as a rule, Yankees or Southerners or Pennsylvania Dutchmen.
We had for a time a second mate, Con Shovelin, an Irishman,
as you might suspect from his name. He was six feet high,
and big in every way, including his voice. He roared and swore
at the crew all the time, but put very little spirit into them. A
look out of the corner of Wilson's eye, and a politely worded
request that they "Get a hump, now!" was worth a volume of
Shovelin's exordiums. At that time an Irishman could not handle
an Irish crew; now, he can handle a crew of free negroes with
the expenditure of one-half the wind and oratory. If you wish
to see for yourself, take a trip on the river to St. Louis and return,
and see the Celt driving the Ethiopian, even as the Saxon drove
the Celt, fifty years ago.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_9"></a>Chapter IX<br />
<i>The "Old Man"</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It would be interesting to trace the origin of this term, which
is universally applied to the captain in nautical circles, either on
shipboard, among deep-sea sailors, on the great lakes, or on the
inland waters. He may not be half as old as the speaker; still,
in speaking of him, not to him, he is the "old man." It is used
in no disrespectful sense; indeed, it is rather an endearing term.
In speaking to him, however, it is always Captain, or Sir. But
in detailing what the Captain has said or done the narrator says
that the "old man" says so, or is about to do so, and his auditors,
if river men, know of but one "old man" aboard the boat, although
the steamer may be freighted with octogenarians.</p>

<p>The captain usually reaches the "roof" from one of two
directions, either going up from mate, or coming down from the
pilot house. Occasionally he emerges from the clerk's office, or
from the engine-room; but the line of promotion is usually drawn
from mate or pilot to captain, these being also the normal lines
of education for that post. Perhaps the greater number of captains
serving on the river in the early days, down to 1860, began
their careers on the river as pilots, very often combining the two
offices in one person.</p>

<p>The captain's official requirements are not altogether ornate.
It is true that he must have sufficient polish to commend himself
to his passengers. That is essential in popularizing his boat; but
in addition he must thoroughly know a steamboat, from stem to
stern, and know what is essential to its safety, the comfort of his
passengers, and the financial satisfaction of its owners. Nearly
every old-time captain on the river could, in case of necessity,
pilot his boat from St. Paul to Galena. Every captain could, and
of necessity did, handle the deck crew, with the second mate as go-between,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
during the captain's watch on deck. Some few might
have gone into the engine-room and taken charge of the machinery,
but these were exceptional cases. All were supposed to know
enough about the business of the office to enable them to determine
between profit and loss in the running of the steamer.</p>

<p>After leaving port, the captain on the river was as autocratic
as his compeer on the ocean. He might without notice discharge
and order ashore any officer or man on board, and he could fill
vacancies en route to any extent; but these appointments were
subject to the approval of the owner or manager on arrival at the
home port. Many, if not most, of the captains owned interests
in the boats which they commanded. Many were sole owners, in
which case they were amenable to no one for their actions, except
to the civil authorities in case of legal technicalities, or to the
unwritten laws of the service, which custom had made binding
upon all. Such, for instance, was the rule that the captain was
not to interfere with the pilots in the running of his boat, even if
he might know, or think he knew, better than they the proper
course to take in certain cases, or under certain conditions; even
though he might himself have a pilot's license hanging in his
stateroom. Neither was it considered good form to interfere with
the duties of his mate, or the engineers, or the chief clerk, in the
way of countermanding their orders when given in the line of
duty. He might call them to account in his office, and not only
caution, but command them not to repeat the error. Only in cases
where such interference was necessary for the safety of the boat
was it deemed permissible; and a captain who so far forgot himself
as to interfere, lost caste among all classes of rivermen, high and
low. Nevertheless, the "old man" had supreme power, and had
the authority to interpose his veto on any command or any action,
by any of his officers or men. This supremacy threw the burden
of responsibility upon his shoulders, and set him apart as a man
by himself.</p>

<p>The seat of power was in the forward part of the "Texas",
where a commodious and handsomely-furnished cabin served as
office, audience-room, sitting-room, and whenever he so willed, as
dining-room. Connected with it was a sleeping apartment, larger
and better furnished than the ordinary staterooms in the passenger
cabin. From the windows on the front and on two sides of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
sitting-room he could look out ahead, or on either side, and see
everything that was going on. It was here that he entertained
favored guests when in relaxation, or hetcheled contumacious officers
when in tenser moods.</p>

<p>From his berth, directly under the pilot house, he could read
the sounds of shuffling feet as the man on watch danced from side
to side of his wheel; he could note the sounds of the bell-pulls, as
signals were rung in the engine-room; and he could tell very nearly
where the boat was at such times, and judge very cleverly as to the
luck the pilot was having in running an ugly piece of river, or
working out a crooked crossing. He could look out and see if his
mate was asleep alongside the big bell, in the drowsy hours of
the morning watch, if he cared to confirm a shrewd bet that the
mate was asleep. He could tell by the roar of the forced draft
in the tall chimneys in front of him, that there was another boat
in sight, either ahead or behind, and that Billy Hamilton had the
"blowers" on in response to a suggestion from Tommy Cushing,
at the wheel, that an excess of steam was desirable, and that at
once. This last was a perennial, or nocturnal, source of annoyance
to our "Old Man", and one that wrung from him more protests
than any other shortcoming under his command. It burned
out more wood than was justified by the end attained; but what
was of more serious import, it suggested the carrying of a greater
head of steam than was consonant with perfect safety. At a time
when boiler explosions were not infrequent on the Western rivers,
any suggestion of extra steam-carrying was sufficient to put the
"old man" on the alert; and this led to more interference with his
officers than any other cause that came under my observation
during my brief experience on the river. A scantily-clad apparition
would appear on deck forward of the "Texas", and a request,
"Mr. Cushing, please ask Mr. Hamilton to cut off the blowers",
would be passed down the speaking tube to the engine-room.
While it always came in the form of request, it carried with it
the force of command&mdash;until it was concluded that the "old
man" was again asleep, when the blowers were cautiously and
gradually reopened.</p>

<p>While it was not always expected that the captain should take
the place of the engineer or pilot, it was required that he should
be thoroughly acquainted with the handling of a steamboat under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
all circumstances. He must be a man possessed of nerve and
courage, quick to see what was required, and as quick to give the
necessary commands to his crew. As on deeper water, the code of
honor on the river held that the captain must be the last to leave
his sinking or burning boat; and many a brave commander has
gone down to honorable death while upholding this code. In case
of fire he must, with the pilot, instantly decide where lay the
greatest chances of safety in beaching his boat. In case of snagging,
or being cut down by ice, it is his first duty to save his boat,
if possible, by stopping the break, at the same time providing for
the safety of his passengers by beaching her on the nearest sand-bar.
In case of grounding&mdash;"getting stuck on a sand-bar", as it is
popularly known&mdash;all his knowledge of every expedient to extricate
his vessel known to river men is called in play at once. An
hour's time, or even a few minutes, lost in trying cheap experiments,
is sufficient to pile up the shifting sands about the hull to
such an extent as sometimes to consume days, or even weeks, in
getting free.</p>

<p>Our own boat, the "Fanny Harris", drifted upon a submerged
bank on the lower side of the cut-off between Fevre River and
Harris Slough, with a falling river. She did not get off that day,
and within three days had less than a foot of water under some
parts of her hull. Her freight had to be lightered, and then it
took two steamboats, pulling on quadruple tackles, "luffed" together,
to pull her into deep water. The power applied would
have pulled her in two, had it come from opposite directions.</p>

<p>"Sparring off" was a science in itself. Just how to place
your spars; in what direction to shove the bow of the boat; or
whether to "walk her over" by setting the spars at a "fore and
aft" angle, one on each side, and thus push the boat straight ahead&mdash;these
were questions to be answered as soon as reports were
received from the pilot who was sent out in the yawl to sound the
whole bar. To a landsman, the use to which were to be put the
great sticks of straight-grained, flawless yellow (or Norway) pine,
standing on either side of the gangway, was quite unknown until
the boat brought up on the sandy bottom of the river. Then, if
it was the first time these timbers had been called into play that
season, the lashings were cut away with a sharp axe; the detail
from the crew sent to the roof eased away on the falls, until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
derricks leaned forward at an angle of forty-five degrees. The
crew on the forecastle overhauled the great four-by-five, or five-by-six
ply falls, and hooked the lower block into the iron ring
under the steamer's quarter, just above the load-line. This ring
was attached to the hull by massive bolts, extending through several
feet of timbers on the inside of the sheathing&mdash;the timbers running
back the length of the hull, in well-built boats, so that with
sufficiently solid footing for the spars, and with sufficient power,
the steamer might be lifted bodily off the bar, without "hogging"
the boat&mdash;the technical term for bending or breaking the hull
out of shape.</p>

<p>When it was decided by a conference of the captain, the
pilots, and the mate, or by the captain's judgment alone, in what
direction the bow of the boat was to be thrown, the foot of the
spar was shoved clear of the guards and lowered away by the
derrick-fall until its foot was firmly fixed, and the spar at the
proper angle, and in the proper direction. The hauling part of
the tackle (or fall, as it is called) was then passed through a
snatch-block and carried to the capstan, around the barrel of which
six or seven turns were taken, and the best man in the crew given
charge of the free end. If the case was a very bad one&mdash;if the
boat was on hard&mdash;the double-purchase gear was put on the
capstan, to give additional power, and steam was turned on the
hoisting engine, (or "donkey") which also operated the capstan
by a clutch gear. Ordinarily the boat quickly responded to all
this application of power, was slowly pushed off the reef and
headed for the channel, and the wheel was soon able to drive her
ahead and away from the bar.</p>

<p>This taking care of the free end of the tackle as it came from
the capstan, was a work of more importance than might appear
to the novice. The barrel of the capstan is concave; the line
feeds on to it at the thickest part, either at the top or the bottom
of the capstan. After it reaches a certain point all the turns must
slip down to the narrowest part, and the work of winding upward
begin over. The man who is handling the free end of the line
must often slack a little&mdash;just enough to start the slipping&mdash;and
then hold hard, so that it may go down easily, without giving
any further slack. It looks easy, but it isn't. I have seen a careless
man give so much slack to his line, when there was a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
heavy strain upon it&mdash;in fact when the whole weight of the
forward end of the steamer was pendant upon the spar&mdash;that the
recoil of the tackle, though not over an inch or two, would let the
hull drop with a force that would almost shake the chimneys out
of her, and could be felt the length of the boat. It was also a
post of some danger, as I have heard of instances in which the
recoil snapped the tackle, and severely injured the men under
and about the spar and capstan.</p>

<p>The spars are shod with heavy iron points about a foot in
length, which would grip the solid clay or gravel underlying the
superficial layers of sand forming the bar. When there was "no
bottom" to the sand, and the applied power, instead of lifting the
steamer only shoved the spar into the quicksand, another footing
was used&mdash;a block built of two three-inch sections of oak about
eighteen inches in diameter, bound and crossed with iron, and
having a hole in the centre through which the iron point of the
spar was passed until the shoulder rested on the block. This
block could not be driven deeply into the sand, and usually gave a
secure footing. A rope attached to a ring in the block served to
haul it out of the sand after the spar was hoisted aboard.</p>

<p>The spectacle afforded by the "sparring off" process was
always one of great interest to the passengers, and of excitement
to the officers and crew. There were drawbacks to this interest,
however, when the passengers were in a hurry, and the boat lay
for hours, sometimes for days, before being released, the crew working
day and night without sleep, and with little time even to eat.
We once lay three days on Beef Slough bar; and the "War Eagle"
was eight days on the same bar, having been caught on a falling
river, being only released after passengers and freight were transferred
to other and lighter boats.</p>

<p>For the officers and crew, there was no halo about an incident
of this kind. In low water, it was to some boats of almost daily
occurrence, somewhere on the river, even with the most skilful
pilots. The fact was, that there were places where there was
not enough water in the channel for a boat to pass without striking;
and if one got out of the channel by ever so little, it was of course
still worse. There were several places where it was to be expected
that the boat must be hauled over the reef by taking out an anchor
ahead, or by hauling on a line attached to a tree on the bank, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the channel ran near enough to render the latter expedient possible.</p>

<p>I have injected this description of sparring off into the chapter
devoted to the "Old Man", not because the process necessarily
devolved upon him alone; but because as captain his will was law
in any disputed point, and because upon him rested the responsibility
of navigating his boat. He naturally took an active interest
in the work, and was always on hand when it was done. But
quite often the mate knew more of the <i>finesse</i> of poling a boat off
a bar, than did the captain; and some captains were shrewd enough
to give the mate practically full control, only standing on the roof
for appearance sake, while the latter did the work. It was,
however, every man's work, and if any one had a practical idea,
or a practical suggestion, whether pilot, engineer, mate, or carpenter,
it was quickly put to the test. The main thing was to
get off the bar, and to get off "quick."</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_10"></a>Chapter X<br />
<i>The Pilots and Their Work</i></h2>
</div>

<p>We come now to the consideration of that part of river life
of which I was an interested observer, rather than an active
participant. Had not the great war burst upon the country, and
the fever of railroad construction run so high, it is possible that I
might have had my name enrolled in the list containing such
masters of the profession as William Fisher, John King, Ed. West,
Thomas Burns, Thomas Cushing, and a hundred others whose
names were synonyms for courage, precision, coolness in danger,
exact knowledge, ready resource, and all else necessary in the man
who stood at the wheel and safely guided a great steamer through
hundreds of miles of unlighted and uncharted river.</p>

<p>Compared with those days, the piloting of to-day, while still
a marvel to the uninitiated, is but a primer compared to the knowledge
absolutely necessary to carry a steamboat safely through and
around the reefs, bars, snags, and sunken wrecks which in the
olden time beset the navigator from New Orleans to St. Paul.
The pilot of that day was absolutely dependent upon his knowledge
of and familiarity with the natural landmarks on either bank of
the river, for guidance in working his way through and over the
innumerable sand-bars and crossings. No lights on shore guided
him by night, and no "diamond boards" gave him assurance by
day. No ready search-light revealed the "marks" along the shore.
Only a perspective of bluffs, sometimes miles away, showing dimly
outlined against a leaden sky, guided the pilot in picking his way
over a dangerous crossing, where there was often less than forty
feet to spare on either side of the boat's hull, between safety and
destruction.</p>

<p>To "know the river" under those conditions meant to know
absolutely the outline of every range of bluffs and hills, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
as every isolated knob or even tree-top. It meant that the man
at the wheel must know these outlines absolutely, under the constantly
changing point of view of the moving steamer; so that he
might confidently point his steamer at a solid wall of blackness,
and guided only by the shapes of distant hills, and by the mental
picture which he had of them, know the exact moment at which
to put his wheel over and sheer his boat away from an impending
bank. To-day a thousand beacons are kindled every night to mark
the dangerous or intricate crossings; by day, great white "diamond
boards" spot the banks. At night the pilot has only to jingle a
bell in the engine-room, the dynamo is started, and by pulling a
line at either hand the search-light turns night into day, the big
white board stands out in high relief against the leafy background,
and the pilot heads for it, serene in the confidence that it is placed
in line with the best water; for he knows that the government
engineers have sounded every foot of the crossing within a date
so recent as to make them cognizant of any change in its area
or contour. Constantly patrolling the river, a dozen steamboats,
fully equipped for sounding, measuring, and marking the channel,
are in commission during the months of navigation, each being
in charge of officers graduated from the most exacting military
and technical school in the world, and having under them crews
composed of men educated by practice to meet any emergency
likely to arise. If a snag lodges in the channel it is reported at the
nearest station, or to the first government steamer met, and within
a few hours it is removed. Dams and shear-dykes direct the water
in permanent, unshifting channels. Riprap holds dissolving banks,
and overhanging trees are cut away. Millions of dollars have been
spent in the work, and its preservation costs hundreds of thousands
annually. All this outlay is to-day for the benefit of a scant score
of steamboats between St. Louis and St. Paul. Forty years ago
two hundred men, on a hundred boats, groped their way in darkness,
amid known and unknown terrors, up and down the windings
of the great river, without having for their guidance a single token
of man's helpful invention.</p>

<p>There are men now living who may see all this vast expenditure
utilized, as it is not now. The building of the inter-oceanic
canal across the isthmus is certain to give new direction to the
commerce of the world. It is fair to presume that the Mississippi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
may again assert itself as one of the greatest arteries of commerce
in the world, and that the products of the Minnesota and Dakota
farms will find their way down the river to New Orleans, instead
of across the continent to New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore tidewater. If this effect does follow the building of
the canal, as many clear-headed students of economic problems
predict, the Mississippi will again assume its old-time standing and
influence as a great highway of commerce. The hope is at least
father to this thought.</p>

<p>As already stated, my personal experience as a pilot was
limited. It was confined to a few seasons' study of the river under
one of the best men who ever turned a wheel upon it&mdash;Thomas
Burns. By an agreement with him, I was to retain my clerkship,
but was to spend as much as possible of my time in the pilot house,
while on watch or off, either with himself or his partner, Thomas
Cushing, steering for them in turn, and receiving instruction from
both. Later I was to give all of my time, and after becoming
proficient was to receive their recommendation for a license. I
was then to pay to Captain Burns five hundred dollars from my
first earnings, after getting a berth as a full-fledged pilot. Under
these terms I received instruction from both men, and as opportunity
offered acted as their wheelsman relieving them of much hard
work.</p>

<p>This arrangement was ended by the breaking out of the War
of Secession and the enlistment of Captain Burns in the army.
He raised a company for the Forty-sixth Illinois Infantry, at
Galena, taking about thirty men from the "Fanny Harris" alone.
That was in August, 1861. Thomas Cushing then went down
the river to try his fortune. Two new pilots came aboard, Jim
Black and Harry Tripp, and I was left out of the pilot house.
Later in the season the "Fanny Harris" was left so high on the
bank of the cut-off between Fevre River and Harris Slough that
the whole crew were discharged. It was necessary to build ways
under the boat and launch her, in order to get her back into the
water&mdash;a labor of weeks.</p>

<p>After a short time spent on the "Golden Era" I went up river
and engaged with Charley Jewell, on the "H. S. Allen", Captain
S. E. Gray, running between Prescott and St. Croix Falls. After
a few trips I graduated as a pilot for that run, and conditionally
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
for the Galena and St. Paul run. When the call for three hundred
thousand additional troops came in August, 1862, I decided that
it was my duty to go to the front and "put down the rebellion",
as the "boys" of that time put it. Acting upon this commendable
resolve, I dropped off at Hudson, where I was well acquainted,
and where several companies were organizing for the three years'
service. I enlisted in a company intended for the Twenty-fifth
Wisconsin Infantry, of which Jeremiah Rusk was lieutenant-colonel;
but when we came to be mustered in we were assigned
to the Thirtieth Wisconsin Infantry, as Company A.</p>

<p>My idea was, that if I survived I would return and take up
my work on the river where I left it. That was the boy idea.
It was not realized. After three years of service I was mustered
out in Washington, D. C. I married in the East, and entered
the employ of a steamship company in New York as agent and
superintendent, remaining there until 1876. Returning to Wisconsin
in 1876 I found a half dozen railroads centring in St.
Paul, and these were doing the business of the hundred steamboats
that I had left running in 1862. A dozen boats, confined to two
lines, were handling all the river business between St. Louis and
St. Paul, and the profession of piloting was at an end. Of the
hundred boats that I had known fourteen years before, not one
remained. The average life of a river steamboat was but five years.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, I had by this time lost all interest in river
life, except the interest of a trained observer. I enjoyed watching
the few boats that chanced to come under my observation, and
could appreciate fully the dexterity of the men who were holding
their wheels in the pilot houses; but all my ambitions to again be
one of them appeared to have evaporated, for other lines of work
had engrossed my attention. Engaging in the newspaper business,
and later on adding the responsibility of the agency of a railroad
company, I had enough to think about without pining for lost
opportunities on the river.</p>

<p>The work accomplished by the old-time Mississippi pilot while
guiding his steamer through hundreds of miles of water beset by
snags, wrecks, and reefs, has been so fully described by "Mark
Twain" in his <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>, that it would be temerity
in any one else to attempt to add to what he has so humorously,
and yet so graphically delineated. It rarely occurs that a man

combines a perfect knowledge of a profession so far removed from
the world of letters as is that of piloting a steamboat with the
literary skill to describe its details. It will probably never again
happen that a great master in literature and humor will graduate
from a pilot house.</p>

<p>The experiences of a pilot were the same, however, whether
he turned a wheel on the lower river, as described by "Mark
Twain", or on the upper river. It will not be plagiarizing, therefore,
to tell something of the acquirements necessary in a pilot,
even though the narrative coincides very closely with what he has
recorded of similar experiences on the lower reaches.</p>

<p>Thomas Burns<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> had the reputation of being one of the most
reliable pilots on the upper waters. He was a Scotchman, in
middle life, without vices or failings of any kind, unless smoking
may be a vice. It certainly wasn't so considered on the river, and
for the sake of this story we will not consider it so here. He was
conservative, and would not take any chances, even in a race,
preferring to follow the deep water with safety, rather than cut
corners involving risk to the boat and its cargo, even though a
rival boat did pass him, or he was losing an opportunity to show
off some fancy piloting. It was said of him that he was the only
man who could and did steer a stern-wheel steamboat of four
hundred tons through Coon Slough, downstream, without slowing
or stopping the wheel&mdash;something requiring nerve and fine judgment.
A side-wheel boat usually went around the sharp bend
with one paddle wheel backing and the other going ahead. A
stern-wheel boat was often compelled to "flank" around the elbow,
by backing against the point and letting the current swing the
bow around the bend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
By the old reckoning, the distance from St. Louis to St. Paul,
was eight hundred miles; from Rock Island to St. Paul, four
hundred and fifty. The later survey, after straightening the
channel by wing-dams and dikes, makes the distance seven hundred
and twenty-nine miles from St. Louis, and three hundred and
ninety-eight from Rock Island to St. Paul. It is safe to estimate
a "crossing" in each and every mile of that river. Some miles may
have missed their share, but others had a dozen, so the average
was fully maintained. That was fifty years ago. There are less
crossings now, but more dams and dikes&mdash;two hundred and fifty-one
dams, dikes, and pieces of dikes in the little stretch of river
between St. Paul and Prescott, a matter of thirty-six miles. If a
pilot attempted to make a crossing now, where he made it fifty
years ago, he would in five hundred different places butt his head
into a dike instead of a reef.</p>

<p>Tom Burns, and scores of others like him, knew every rod
of this river better than the average man knows any one mile of
sidewalk between his home and his office. He knew it by day and
by night. He knew it upstream and downstream&mdash;and this
amounted literally to knowing two rivers eight hundred miles long,
for the instant you turn your boat's prow down river you have
entered an entirely new country. Every mark is different; the
bold outlines of bluffs with which you are familiar as you go up
the river, are as strangers when viewed from the reverse side. You
have to learn the stream over again, and worse yet, you have to
learn to handle your boat differently. A novice in the business
might take a steamer from St. Louis to St. Paul with very fair
success, while the same man would hang his boat up effectually
on the first bar he came to, if in going down river he handled
his wheel in the same manner. Coming upstream he might feel
of a reef with the bow of his boat, and if he did not strike the best
water the first time he could back off and try again; but going
downstream he must hit the channel the first time or he is gone.
The current is all the time irresistibly pushing his boat down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
river, and if he strikes he is immediately, with the most disastrous
consequences, swung broadside on to the reef. Tom Burns knew
his river so well that he could jump from his berth on the darkest
night and before he reached the pilot house door could tell what
part of the river the boat was in; the instant his eye caught the
jack staff he knew to a certainty what crossing the steamer was
making, and on what part of the crossing she was at the moment.
This was what every first-class pilot must, and did know. I use
Burns only as an illustration.</p>

<p>It was courtesy for the relieved pilot to state the position of
the boat as he relinquished the wheel to his partner: "Good
morning, Mr. Cushing! A nasty night. She drags a little,
to-night. Just making the upper Cassville crossing. Should have
been farther up. Hope you'll have better luck." This was only
a matter of form and politeness, and not at all necessary. Mr.
Cushing or Mr. Burns knew at a glance that it was the upper
Cassville crossing, and as he took the wheel from the hands of his
retiring partner he did, the next instant, just what the other would
have done had he continued. He saw the "swing" of the jack staff
and met it; he felt the boat edging away from the reef, and coaxed
her back, daintily but firmly, a spoke at a time, or possibly half a
spoke. The continuity was not broken. The exact knowledge
of the retiring pilot was simply carried along by the pilot coming
on watch.</p>

<p>In all the hundreds of miles of river traversed by the boat in
its voyage up or down, there could be no other combination of
marks just like the one which met the pilot's eye as he grasped
the wheel. The problem for the "cub" was to learn the combination.
In the day time it was not customary for the retiring
partner to mention where the boat was at the time. That would
have been stretching the point of courtesy too far. All this, however,
was between equals. When the wheel was turned over to
the "cub", it was generally a prime necessity that he be advised
as to the exact position of the boat. Thus primed, if he was
reasonably advanced, he could take the wheel and with the clue
given the river would shape itself in his mind, and he would pass
from one set of marks to the next with some degree of certitude.
Without the clue, however, it was possible to imagine one's self
in a hundred probable or improbable places. "All bluffs look alike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
to me", might under such circumstances be set to music and sung
with feeling and expression by the learner.</p>

<p>What the pilot must know to enable him to run the river at
night, is strikingly suggested in the conversation between young
"Mark Twain" and his chief, Mr. Bixby. When the boy had
begun to take on airs as a pilot, his chief suddenly fired the
question:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p>"What is the shape of Walnut Bend?"</p>

<p>Of course he did not know, and did not know that he must know.</p>

<p>Mr. Bixby: "My boy, you've got to know the shape of the river,
perfectly. It is all there is left to steer by on a very dark night. Everything
else is blotted out and gone. But mind you, it hasn't the same shape
in the night that it has in the daytime."</p>

<p>"How on earth am I going to learn it, then?"</p>

<p>"How do you follow a hall at home in the dark? Because you know
the shape of it. You can't see it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say I've got to know all the million trifling variations
of the shape of the banks of this interminable river as well as I
know the shape of the front hall at home?"</p>

<p>"On my honor you've got to know them <i>better</i> than any man ever
did know the shapes of the halls in his own house.... You see, this
has got to be learned; there is no getting around it. A clear starlight
night throws such heavy shadows that if you didn't know the shape of
the shore perfectly, you would claw away from every bunch of timber,
because you would take the black shadow of it for a solid cape; and
you see you would be getting scared to death every fifteen minutes by the
watch. You would be fifty yards from shore all the time when you ought
to be within fifty feet of it. You can't see a snag in one of those shadows,
but you know exactly where it is, and the shape of the river tells you
when you are coming to it. Then there's your pitch-dark night; the
river is a very different shape on a pitch-dark night from what it is on a
starlight night. All shores seem straight lines then, and mighty dim
ones, too; you'd run them for straight lines, only you know better. You
boldly drive your boat into what seems to be a solid straight wall (you
knowing very well that there is a curve there), and that wall falls back
and makes way for you. Then there's your gray mist. You take a night
when there's one of those grizzly gray mists, and then there isn't <i>any</i>
particular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle the head of the
oldest man that ever lived. Well, then, different kinds of <i>moonlight</i>
change the shape of the river in different ways. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the cub had wilted. When he came to his chief reassured him
somewhat by replying to his objections:</p>

<p>"No! you only learn <i>the</i> shape of the river; and you learn it with
such absolute certainty that you can always steer by the shape. That's
in your head, and never mind the one that's before your eyes."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
And that was approximately the case. The details of the
river, once learned, were so indellibly printed on the mind of the
pilot that it seemed as though eyes were almost superfluous. Of
course Mr. Bixby stated the extreme case. While the pilot was
running a bend "out of his head" in darkness that might be felt,
there were always well-known landmarks to be seen&mdash;shapes of
bluffs so indistinct as to seem but parts of the universal blackness.
But these indistinct outlines were enough to confirm the judgment
of the man at the wheel in the course he was steering. The man
in the hall, in Mr. Bixby's illustration, could not see anything, and
didn't know what hall he was in. He might just as well have
been blind; and I never heard of a blind man running a steamboat,
day or night. In the short experience that I had in the pilot
house, I did not reach this perfection; but I have stood on one
side of the wheel, mechanically following the orders of my chief,
and listening to the churning of the wheel reëchoed from the
banks not fifty feet away, when I could scarcely see the jack staff,
and could not distinguish between the black of the woods and the
all-pervading black of the night.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns or Mr. Cushing would translate the situation,
as the boat plowed along under a full head of steam, somewhat
like this: "Now we're going down into the bend. Now we're
opposite the big cottonwood. Now we must pull out a little, to
avoid that nest of snags. Now we will let her begin to come out;
the water begins to shoal here; we'll keep away from the point a
little, and cross over into the west bend, and follow that down in
the opposite direction."</p>

<p>This in the way of instruction; and so far as my observation
went he was drawing on his imagination for his facts, as I saw
no big cottonwood, nor nest of snags, nor any point. The only
thing that I could share with him in common was the fact that we
were nearing the point and getting into shoaler water&mdash;the boat
told me that. The floor under my feet seemed to hang back and
drag; the motion of the paddle wheel was perceptibly retarded;
the escape was hoarser from the pipes. I knew that there was
shoal water on the point at the foot of the bend, and the boat
herself told me when we had reached the point; but I had not seen
it, either with my eyes, or in my head. Mr. Burns had it all
in his head, and did not require to see it with his eyes. He simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
ran the bend as he knew it to be; and he ran a hundred others
in the same way.</p>

<p>What might happen to any one who ran by sight, and not by
faith, was illustrated in the case of a young pilot on the "Key
City", of our line. He had his papers, and was standing watch
alone in the pilot house. He was going downstream. In going
into Lansing, Iowa, one runs a long bend on the left-hand shore.
At Lansing the river turns sharply to the south, from a nearly
westerly course. Just at the turn, and fronting the river toward
the east, is a solid limestone bluff four hundred feet high. On a
starlit night the shadow of this bluff is thrown out upon the river
so far as totally to obliterate the water, and for several minutes
one must point his boat straight into an apparently solid bluff
before he "opens out" the turn to the left. On the night in
question the young man forgot to run by what he knew to be the
shape of the river, and trusted to what his eyes showed him. He
lost his head completely, and instead of stopping both wheels and
backing away from the impending doom, he put his wheel hard
over and plumped the "Key City" into the alluvial bank of the
island opposite, with such force as to snatch both chimneys out of
her, and very nearly to make a wreck of the steamer.</p>

<p>I have myself been tempted to run away from the same bluff;
and but for confidence inspired by the presence of one of the pilots,
might have done so. Mr. Burns drilled his "cubs" upon one point,
however, which made for the safety of the boat: "When in doubt,
ring the stopping bell and set her back." There was no place of
safety to run to in a panic on the Mississippi, and a boat standing
still was less likely to hurt herself or any one else than one in
motion.</p>

<p>In no other particular, perhaps, has the art of piloting been
so revolutionized as in the adoption of the electric search-light for
night running. Time and again have I heard the question asked
by people new to the river: "Why don't you hang up two or
three lanterns at the front end of the boat, so that you can see to
steer?"</p>

<p>It is easy to answer such a question convincingly. Go out
into the woods on a very dark night with an ordinary lantern.
How far can you see by such a light? Perhaps thirty feet; twenty
feet would probably be nearer the mark. Until a light was discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
that could project its rays a half mile or more, and so
concentrated as clearly to reveal landmarks at that distance, the
other extreme, no light at all, was not only desirable, but positively
necessary if the boat was to be kept going.</p>

<p>After long usage, a pilot's eyes came to possess powers common
to the cat family and other night prowlers. He could literally
"see in the dark"; but he could not see in any half light, or any
light artificial and close at hand. For this reason it was necessary
to cover every light on the boat while running on a very dark
night, save the red and green sidelights at the chimney-tops. To
accomplish this, heavy canvas "shrouds" or "mufflers" were provided,
which fitted snugly around the forward part of the boat, in
front of the furnaces on the main deck; another set were placed
around the boiler deck, in front of the cabin; and still another
set to muffle the transom sky-lights on the hurricane deck. When
these were properly fitted and triced up, there was not a ray of
light projected forward, to break the dead blackness ahead. So
delicate was this sense of night sight, that no one was permitted
to smoke a pipe or cigar in the pilot house at such times, and even
the mate, sitting by the bell down on the roof below, had to forego
his midnight pipe. As for the pilot himself, a cigar in front of his
nose would have shut off his sight as effectively as though he were
blindfolded.</p>

<p>Of course, were the pilot looking only ten feet, or even forty
feet, ahead of his boat, the lights on board might not have interfered
greatly, although they would not have assisted him in the
slightest. You can not steer a boat by landmarks ten feet ahead
of her. The pilot searches for landmarks a mile away, and must
be able to distinguish between two kinds of blackness&mdash;the blackness
of the night below, and the blackness of the sky above, and
from the dividing line between the two must read his marks and
determine his course. He does not see the woods on either side of
him, and often close at hand. The least ray of artificial light
would blind the pilot to the things which he must see under such
conditions, hence the shrouding of the boat was a necessity, were
she to be run at all on such a night. The coming of the electric
search-light, and the transfer of the marks from distant bluffs to
big white diamond boards planted low down on the banks where
the light can be flashed upon them from a distance of half a mile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
or more, has greatly simplified the work of the pilot, and rendered
obsolete the curtains which once so completely darkened the Mississippi
steamboat on the blackest of nights.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_11"></a>Chapter XI<br />
<i>Knowing the River</i></h2>
</div>

<p>To "know the river" fully, the pilot must not only know
everything which may be seen by the eye, but he must also feel
for a great deal of information of the first importance which is not
revealed to the eye alone. Where the water warrants it, he
reaches for this information with a lead line; as on the lower
river, where the water is deeper, and the draft of boats correspondingly
great. On the upper river, a twelve-foot pole answers
instead. The performance is always one of great interest to the
passengers; the results are often of greater interest to the man at
the wheel. The manner in which the reports of the leadsman are
received and digested by the pilot, is not usually known to or
comprehended by the uninitiated. The proceeding is picturesque,
and adds one more "feature" to the novelties of the trip. It is
always watched with the greatest interest by the tourist, and is
apparently always enjoyed by them, whatever the effect upon the
pilot; whether he enjoys it or not depends on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Soundings are not always necessarily for the immediate and
present purpose of working the boat over any particular bar, at the
particular time at which they are taken, although they may be
taken for that purpose and no other. In general, during the season
of low water, the leads are kept going in all difficult places as
much for the purpose of comparison as for the immediate purpose
of feeling one's way over the especial reef or bar where the soundings
are taken. If it is suspected that a reef is "making down",
the pilot wants to satisfy himself on that point, so that he may
readjust his marks to meet the changed outlines. If a reef is
"dissolving", he also wants to know that, and readjust his marks
accordingly&mdash;only in the first place, his marks will be set lower
down the river; in case of a dissolving reef, his marks will be set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
farther upstream, to follow the deep water which is always found
close under the reef&mdash;that is, on the downstream side. The
shallowest water is always on the crest of the reef, and it "tapers"
back, upstream, very gradually, for rods&mdash;sometimes for half a
mile or even more, until another reef is reached, with deep water
under it, and another system of shallows above.</p>

<p>This is where the perfection of the pilot's memory machine
is demonstrated along another line. He has acquainted himself
with every bluff, hill, rock, tree, stump, house, woodpile, and
whatever else is to be noted along the banks of the river. He has
further added to this fund of information a photographic negative
in his mind, showing the shape of all the curves, bends, capes,
and points of the river's banks, so that he may shut his eyes, yet see
it all, and with such certainty that he can, on a night so perfectly
black that the shore line is blotted out, run his boat within fifty
feet of the shore and dodge snags, wrecks, overhanging trees, and
all other obstacles by running the shape of the river as he knows it
to be&mdash;not as he can see it. In sounding, he is mentally charting
the bottom of the river as he has already charted the surface and
its surroundings.</p>

<p>As he approaches the crossing which he wishes to verify, he
pulls the rope attached to the tongue of the big bell on the roof,
and sounds one stroke, and an instant later two strokes. The
captain or mate on watch sings out: "Starboard lead!" "Larboard
lead!" and the men detailed for the duty are at their stations
in a minute or less after the order is given. Then the cry, first
from starboard and then from port, long-drawn and often musical:
"No-o-o bottom; no-o-o bottom!" rises from the fo'c'sle, and is
repeated by the captain or mate to the pilot. "Mar-r-k twain,
mar-r-r-k twain!" indicates soundings the depth of the sounding
pole&mdash;twelve feet, or two fathoms. This is of no interest to the
pilot, for he knew there was "no bottom" and "two fathoms"
before the soundings were taken. It is of the highest interest to
the passengers, however, to whom the cry of "no bottom" seems
a paradox, when the boat has been rubbing the bottom most of
the way from Rock Island up. They have not yet been taught
that this simply means no bottom with a twelve-foot pole, and does
not indicate that the Mississippi is a bottomless stream at this or
any other point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
On the upper river, the cry of "ten feet, eight and a half", or
even "six feet", does not strike any sensitive spot in the pilot's
mental machinery, for upper river men are used to running "where
there is a heavy dew". On such occasions he might listen to the
latest story, detailed by a visiting comrade, and even take part in
the conversation, apparently indifferent to the monotonous cries
from the lower deck. But all the time his brain is fitting the
leadsman's cries to the marks in which the cries have found his
boat&mdash;not consciously, perhaps, but nevertheless surely. He has
not only fitted the cry into the marks, but has mentally compared
the present with the depth of water cried at the same spot last trip,
and the trip before that, and noted the change, if any has taken
place. Say the leadsman has sung "six feet", "six feet", "six
feet", "six feet", "six feet", until you would think there was no
other depth but six feet in the river; then in the same tone he sings
"five-and-a-half", "six feet", "six feet", "six feet". The pilot is
still talking with his visitor, watching his marks and turning his
wheel; but he has picked out that "five-and-a-half" and stored it
away for future reference, together with all the surroundings of
his boat at the instant the call reached his ear&mdash;the marks ahead,
astern, and on either side. The next trip, as the leadsman sings
"six feet", "six feet", "six feet", he will be shocked and grievously
disappointed if he does not find his "five-and-a-half" at just that
point. And he will not be counting the "six feet" cries, nor,
possibly, will he be aware that he is looking for the "five-and-a-half".
When he drops into the marks where the "five-and-a-half"
found him last week, if he hears only the "six feet", he will be
in a similar frame of mind to the man who, coming into town,
misses a prominent tree or house, and asks: "Where is that big
tree that stood on the corner, when I was here last time"?</p>

<p>The pilot does all this without realizing that he is making
any mental effort. When he begins this sort of drill as a "cub", he
realizes it fully; and if he is half sharp he will open an account
with every shoal place between Rock Island and St. Paul, and set
down in writing the soundings on the lowest place on each reef,
and try to supply the marks in which his steamer lay when the
cry was heard. As he grows in his studies he will rely less on his
notebook and more upon his memory, until the mental picture of
the bottom of the river becomes as vivid as that of the surface.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Then, when his chief asks suddenly: "How much water was
there on the middle crossing at Beef Slough last trip"? he can
answer promptly: "Four feet on starboard, four feet scant on
port".</p>

<p>"How much trip before last?"</p>

<p>"Four feet large, both sides."</p>

<p>"Right, my boy; you're doing well."</p>

<p>If that "cub" doesn't grow an inch in a minute, under these
circumstances, he isn't the right kind of boy to have around.</p>

<p>Naturally the boys studied the "nightmares", first of all. If
they could get over Cassville, Brownsville, Trempealeau, Rolling-stone,
Beef Slough, Prescott, Grey Cloud, and Pig's Eye, they
could manage all the rest of the river. But the leads were kept
going in fifty other places which, while not so bad, had enough
possibilities to warrant the closest watching. The chiefs were
making mental notes of all these places, and could tell you the
soundings on every crossing where a lead had been cast, as readily
as the "cubs" could recite the capital letter readings of Beef Slough
and Pig's Eye. The miracle of it was, how they could do this
without giving any apparent attention to the matter at the time.
They struck the bell, the leadsman sang, the mate or captain
repeated the cries mechanically, while the pilot appeared to pay
little or no attention to the matter. When he had enough of the
music he tapped the bell to lay in the leads, and nothing was said
as to the results. Yet if asked at St. Paul by a brother pilot how
much water he found on any one of a hundred crossings of average
depth, he could tell, without hesitation, just where he found the
lowest cast of the lead.</p>

<p>In my experience as a printer I have stood at the case and set
up an editorial out of my head (how "able" I will not pretend to
say), at the same time keeping up a spirited argument on politics
or religion with a visitor. The thinking appeared to be all devoted
to the argument; it was probably the talking only. To set the
type required no thought at all; that was purely mechanical; and
to compose the editorial was the unconscious operation of the
mind, accustomed to doing just this sort of thing, until the framing
of words into sentences became more or less mechanical. Certainly
the mental drill of a river pilot along a very few lines, developed
a memory for the things pertaining to his profession which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
wonderful, when you sit down and attempt to analyze it. To the
men themselves it was not a wonder&mdash;it was the merest commonplace.
It was among the things which you must acquire before
you could pilot a steamboat; and for a consideration they would
covenant to teach any boy of average mental ability and common
sense all these things, provided always that he had the physical
ability to handle a wheel, and provided also, that he demonstrated
in time of trial that he had the "nerve" necessary for the business.
A timid, cowardly, or doubting person had no business in the
pilot house. If it were possible for him to acquire all the rest,
and he lacked the nerve to steady him in time of danger, he was
promptly dropped out of the business.</p>

<p>I saw this illustrated in the case of a rapids pilot between
St. Paul and St. Anthony. We always made this trip when a
cargo of flour was offered by the one mill which in that early
day represented all there was of that great interest which now
dominates the business of Minneapolis. While our pilots were
both capable of taking the boat to St. Anthony and back, the
underwriters required that we should take a special pilot for the
trip&mdash;one who made a specialty of that run. On the occasion
in point we had taken an unusually heavy cargo, as the river was
at a good stage. At that time the channel was very crooked,
winding about between reefs of solid rock, with an eight to ten
mile current. It required skilful manipulation of the wheel to keep
the stern of the boat off the rocks. In going downstream it is
comparatively easy to get the bow of a steamer around a crooked
place; it is not easy to keep the stern from swinging into danger.
In this case the stern of the steamer struck a rock reef with such
force as to tear one of the wing rudders out by the roots, in doing
which enough noise was made to warrant the belief that half the
boat was gone. The special pilot was satisfied that such was the
case, and exclaimed: "She is gone!" at the same time letting go
the wheel and jumping for the pilot house door. She would have
been smashed into kindlings in a minute if she had been left to
herself, or had the engines been stopped even for an instant. Fortunately
the rapids pilot was so scared by the noise of rending
timbers and wheel-buckets that he did not have nerve enough left
to ring a bell, and the engineer on watch was not going to stop
until a bell was rung, as he knew that the drift of a minute in
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
that white water, would pile us up on the next reef below. Fortunately
for the "Fanny Harris", Tom Cushing was in the pilot
house, as well as myself. When the other man dropped the wheel
Cushing jumped for it, and fired an order to me to get hold of
the other side of the wheel, and for the next six miles he turned
and twisted among the reefs, under a full head of steam, which
was necessary to give us steerageway in such a current. We
never stopped until we reached St. Paul, where we ran over to
the west shore, it being shallow, and beached the boat. When she
struck land the captain took the special pilot by the collar and
kicked him ashore, at the same time giving him the benefit of
the strongest language in use on the river at that time. Beyond
the loss of a rudder and some buckets from the wheel, the boat
was not seriously damaged, and we continued the voyage to Galena
as we were. Had Tom Cushing not been in the pilot house at the
time, she would have been a wreck in the rapids a mile or so
below St. Anthony Falls. The rapids pilot lost his certificate.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_12"></a>Chapter XII<br />
<i>The Art of Steering</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Every pilot must of necessity be a steersman; but not every
steersman is of necessity a pilot. He may be studying to become
a pilot, and not yet out of the steersman stage. "Cubs" begin
their studies by steering for their chiefs. Many boys become quite
expert in handling a boat, under the eyes of their chiefs, before
they are sufficiently acquainted with the river to be trusted alone
at the wheel for any length of time.</p>

<p>At first thought, one might imagine a number of favorable
conditions as prerequisite to the ideal in steering: a straight piece
of river, plenty of water, and an average steamboat. These would
indeed guarantee leaving a straight wake; but under such conditions
a roustabout might accomplish this. The artistic quality is developed
in the handling of a boat under the usual conditions&mdash;in
making the multitudinous crossings, where the jack staff is continually
swinging from side to side as the boat is dodging reefs
and hunting the best water. In doing this, one man puts his
wheel so hard down, and holds it so long, that he finds it necessary
to put the wheel to the very opposite to check the swing of the
boat and head it back to its proper course, in which evolution he
has twice placed his rudder almost squarely across the stern of his
boat. If this athletic procedure is persevered in at every change
of course, it will materially retard the speed of the steamer and
leave a wake full of acute angles, besides giving the steersman an
unnecessary amount of work.</p>

<p>The skilled steersman, combining his art with his exact
knowledge of the bottom of the river, will give his boat only enough
wheel to lay her into her "marks", closely shaving the points of
the reefs and bars, and will "meet her" so gradually and so soon
as to check the swing of the jack staff at the exact moment when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the "marks" are reached. There is then no putting the wheel over
to bring the boat back, after having overreached her marks, and
the rudders have at no time been more than a quarter out of line
with the hull of the boat. It is this delicate handling of the
wheel, which differentiates between the artist and the athlete.</p>

<p>Steamboats have their individuality, the same as pilots and
steersmen. There are boats (or have been), that would almost
steer themselves, while there are others so perverse and tricky
that no one could feel sure of keeping them in the river for any
consecutive two miles. The "Ocean Wave" was, perhaps, the most
unreliable and tricky of all the craft on the upper river&mdash;or any
river. In low water no one man ever thought of standing a watch
alone at the wheel, and at times she would run away with two
men at the wheel. She was short, "stubby", and narrow; and
when she smelt a reef she would, unless very carefully handled,
under a slow bell, run away from it, often with one paddle wheel
backing while the other was coming ahead, and the rudder standing
squarely across the stern. Many times she has plumped into the
bank under these conditions, and nothing less than the bank would
stop her. The "City Belle", the "Favorite", and the "Frank
Steele" were built much like the "Ocean Wave", but were not
quite so unreliable in steering. She was in a class by herself.
On the other hand, the "Key City", one of the largest, longest,
and finest of the up-river packets, was so well-balanced, and her
hull so finely moulded, that it was a delight to handle her, even
under otherwise unfavorable conditions, such as low water, or
high winds.</p>

<p>A stern-wheel boat going downstream when the wind was
blowing up the river, was about as helpless a craft to handle as
could well be imagined. After she was once "straightened down"
she was all right; but in attempting to get her nose pointed down
river, after having made a landing, there were more profane
possibilities than the uninitiated ever dreamed of. The current,
acting on the stern of the boat and the partially-submerged wheel,
was all the time pulling that end of the boat downstream; while
the wind, acting upon the tall chimneys and the pilot house and
"Texas", was at the same time pushing the bow of the boat upstream;
and the pilot was all the while endeavoring to reverse this
position, and get the bow of his boat pointed in the direction in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
which he wished to go. It sometimes took hours to accomplish
this, particularly if caught in places where the river was narrow
and correspondingly swift, and the wind strong and contrary. The
only way to swing a stern-wheel boat was, to put the steering
wheel hard over, throwing the four rudders as far to one side
as possible, and then back strongly against them. Under this
leverage if there was no wind, the boat would swing easily and
promptly, until her head was pointed downstream; and then by
coming ahead and gaining steerageway, the boat was under perfect
control. But when the wind was blowing upstream, it was often
found impracticable to back fast and far enough to gain the necessary
momentum to swing her in a narrow place; the engines
would have to be stopped before the boat was swung to more than
a right angle with the river, and then, before steerageway was
gained after coming ahead, the bow of the boat would again be
pointing upstream, and the same performance would have to be
gone through with&mdash;sometimes a dozen or twenty times, before
the boat would get under way in the proper direction.</p>

<p>In 1881 I saw Henry Link, after having made a landing at
Newport, back the "Mary Morton", of the Diamond Jo Line,
more than five miles down the river, she having swung stern-down
at that place. He see-sawed back and forth across the stream,
first in one direction and then in another, and failed at last to
swing his boat against the strong south wind which was blowing.
He finally gave it up and ran ashore, and getting out a line
to a big tree, backed his craft around until her bow was pointed
downstream, and then made a start from a broadside position
against the bank. I happened to be a passenger on the boat at
the time. His remarks on that occasion were unprintable. A
side-wheel boat, under the same conditions, would have backed
out into the river, come ahead on one wheel while backing on
the other, and in two or three minutes would have been going
full speed ahead on the desired course. That is the beauty of
the independent side-wheel system. It is a great saving of labor
and morality for the steersman, and a great saving of time for
the owners.</p>

<p>It would seem that if you could get the bow of your boat
clear of the bank, or of an overhanging tree, after pointing in
pretty close, that the rest of the boat would follow the bow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
likewise come out, without any undue intimacy with the trees
or bank. It takes only one trial to disabuse a beginner of this
notion. The balance of the boat does not follow the bow out of
such a position; and while every pilot knows the immutable
laws of physics which operate upon his boat under such circumstances,
most of them, sooner or later, get caught, either through
carelessness or recklessness, just as the green cub does through
ignorance.</p>

<p>In running downstream, when you point into the bank, and
shave it closely, you pull the bow of the boat away, and then
there are two forces over which you have no control with your
steering wheel: the impetus of the after half of your boat is still
in the direction of the bank, after the forward half has begun
to swing away; which would also be the case in a perfectly dead
lake. In the river, you have the second force in the current
which is pressing against the whole of the hull, but more particularly
against the after part, and this is pushing the boat in
toward the bank after you have pulled her bow away from it.
The result is, that while you may clear the bank with the bow
of the boat, the stern swings in and gets the punishment.</p>

<p>Because of these two laws of physics, it was almost impossible
to run a stern-wheel boat around the sharp bend in Coon Slough,
a feat which "Tom" Burns performed several times without
stopping a wheel. "Jack" Harris tried it with the big side-wheeler,
the "Northern Light", late in the fall, when the anchor
ice was running. Her bow got around all right; but her stern
swung into the ice which had lodged in the bend, with the result
that the whole stern was torn away, and she sank in twenty
feet of water. "Ned" West tried a similar experiment at Dayton
Bluff, just below St. Paul, with the "Key City". He ran in very
close to the rocky shore, under full headway. He got her head
out in good shape, but the stern struck the rocks, tearing out the
rudder and smashing the deadwood. He worked her back to
St. Paul with the wheels alone, and there the damage was repaired.
I doubt if he was even reprimanded, for he was the "fastest"
pilot on the upper river, as well as one of the best, and getting
eight hundred dollars a month for his services. He could get
a boat over the course from St. Louis to St. Paul, in less time
than any other pilot could take the same boat, and that of course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
carried with it the supposition that he knew the river as well as
any man.</p>

<p>I learned the lesson myself through inattention. I was well
acquainted with the principle through precept, and had been
very careful not to run too near the bank. Coming down from
St. Croix Falls with the "H. S. Allen", on reaching the mouth
of the Apple River, I saw a school of black bass lying on the
white sandy bottom where the Apple River empties into the St.
Croix. The inflow from Apple River sets almost squarely across
the St. Croix, and when the former is in flood the current sets
nearly across the channel. To meet it, it is necessary to point
toward the incoming current, to prevent being thrown against
the opposite bank. Being an ardent fisherman I was deeply interested
in the scores of fine fish plainly distinguishable from the
height of the pilot house. The result was inevitable. I neglected
to point the bow of the boat sufficiently against the inflow, and
she took a sheer for the opposite bank the instant she struck
the cross current. I pulled the wheel hard over in an instant,
and got the bow clear of the overhanging timber, but the stern
went under, and when it came out the "H. S. Allen" lacked two
escape pipes and half of the washroom and laundry. The stewardess
herself was short about half her senses, and all her temper.
The captain had seen the same trick performed by older and
better pilots than myself, and was not unduly distressed. It took
about one hundred dollars to make the boat presentable. I did
not tell about the black bass for some time after the incident
occurred&mdash;long enough after so that there would be no obvious
connection between the fish and the missing laundry.</p>

<p>The man who has once mastered the art of steering a steamboat
on Western waters, never loses his love for it. Whatever
may have been his occupation after leaving the river, his hands
instinctively reach out for the wheel if fortune so favors him as
to place the opportunity within his reach. I mean, of course,
the man who sees and feels more than the mere turning of the
wheel so many hours a day, for so much money to be paid at
the completion of his task. It may be work, and hard work,
for the enthusiast as well as for the hireling; but with the man
who puts his spirit into the task, it is work ennobled by painstaking
devotion, and glorified by the realization of work artistically and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
lovingly done. To such a man there is an exhilaration about the
handling of a big steamboat in the crooked channels of the Great
River, akin to that felt by the accomplished horseman when
guiding a spirited team of roadsters, or that of the engineer,
holding the throttle of a great locomotive rushing over the rails
at a speed of sixty miles an hour. However long the hands of
the horseman or the engineer may have been divorced from reins
or throttle, there is the same longing to grasp the one or the other
when the opportunity offers. It is a wholly natural craving of
the inner being; and however inexplicable it may be, it is there.</p>

<p>For forty years, since leaving the river for other pursuits,
often harassing and full of care, I have dreamed, time and again,
of holding a wheel on one of the old-time boats on which I
served as a boy. In my sleep I have felt again the satisfaction
in work well done, the mortification of failure, and have felt again
the cares and responsibilities that weighed so heavily when beset
with difficulties and dangers. It is all as real as though I again
stood at the wheel, doing real work, and achieving real victories
over besetting difficulties and dangers. Mere work, as a means
of earning a living, would not take such hold upon one's nature.
It is the soul of the artist incarnate in the pilot.</p>

<i>An Initiation</i></h2>
</div>

<p>I have said that in addition to "knowing the river", and
knowing that he knows it, the young pilot must also be fortified
with a large measure of self-reliance, or all else will go for
nothing. The time of trial comes to every one, sooner or later,
and the manner in which it is met usually determines the standing
of the young novitiate in the estimation of river men. The reputation
of every man on the river is common property the length
of his run, from St. Louis to St. Paul. It was proverbial that
river men "talked shop" more than any others, in those early days,
probably because they were more interested in their own business
than they were in that of other men. Possibly because, as one
government engineer stated it, they didn't know anything else.
However, the doings of all the river men were pretty thoroughly
discussed sooner or later, from the latest dare-devil exhibition of
fancy piloting by "Ned" West, to the mistakes and mishaps of the
youngest "cub". Sooner or later, each and all were served up
at the casual meetings of river men, at whatever port they might
foregather.</p>

<p>My own "baptism"&mdash;not of "fire", but of water and lightning&mdash;came
on the very first trip I made alone on a steamboat.
I had been running with Charley Jewell on the "H. S. Allen",
from Prescott to St. Croix Falls. Mr. Jewell fell sick and was
laid off at Prescott. On the levee, the day he went home, was
a steamboat load of rope, rigging, boats, and camp-equipage,
together with a couple of hundred raftsmen landed from a down-river
packet that did not care to make the run up the lake. The
disembarked men were anxious to reach Stillwater with their
cargo, that night. Our regular starting time, as a United States
mail boat, was at 7 o'clock in the morning. They offered extra
compensation if we would take them up that night, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
the proposition was accepted by Captain Gray. All hands were
set to work loading the stuff. I felt quite elated at the prospect,
as it was a bright evening, and I felt sure of finding my way, for
there were only three or four close places to run in the thirty
miles of lake navigation between Prescott and Stillwater.</p>

<p>We got everything aboard, and I backed her out and started
up the lake. There had been some lightning in the north, where
there was a bank of low-lying clouds. So far away were they, apparently,
that no one thought of a storm, certainly not a serious
one. We were running toward it, however, and as we soon
discovered, it was coming to meet us at a rattling pace. We met
when about six miles above Prescott. First a terrific wind out
of the north, followed by torrents of rain, and incessant lightning,
which took on the appearance of chain-mail as it shimmered and
glittered on the falling rain drops. I put up the breast-board,
and let down the head-board as far as I could and still leave room
between to look out ahead; but the fierce wind drove the rain in
sheets into the pilot house, and in a minute's time I was completely
soaked. The lightning and thunder were terrifying in brilliancy
and in sharpness of sound, the flash and the report coming so
closely together as to leave no doubt that the bolts were getting
seriously close to the smokestacks. The pilot house was not the
place I would have chosen from which to enjoy these effects, had
I my choice. The place I really longed for was somewhere down
below, where I would have felt less conspicuous as a target.</p>

<p>I managed to work my way around the Kinnickinnic bar, and
made the run up to the Afton (or "Catfish") bar, around which
the channel was quite narrow and wofully crooked. Thus far,
the high banks had sheltered us somewhat from the wind. Here,
however, the low-lying prairie came down to the water's edge.
The sweep of the wind was terrific, while the downpour of rain
was such that at times it was impossible to see any landmarks a
hundred feet away. Captain Gray, wrapped in his storm clothes,
who had, since the tempest broke, staid on the roof, one eye on
the banks, when he could see them, and the other on the young
man at the wheel, finally called up and wanted to know if I did
not think we had better feel our way ashore and tie up until the
storm abated, even at the risk of being late in getting back to
Prescott to take up our regular trip in the morning. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
shivering so that my teeth chattered, and the captain would have
been fully justified in assuming that I was shaking as much from
fear as from cold. I had a deal of pride in those days, however,
and a fair allowance of inherited courage, with perhaps a dash
of pig-headedness. I did not wish to have it bulletined from one
end of the river to the other that the first time I was left in
charge of a steamboat, I had hunted a tree to tie up to because
it happened to thunder and rain a little. That would have been
the popular version of the incident, in any case. I replied, therefore,
that if Captain Gray would send his waiter up with a glass
of brandy, I would take the steamer to Hudson levee before taking
out a line, and from there to Stillwater and back to Prescott in
time for our morning run. The captain said nothing, then or
thereafter, but sent his "boy" up with the brandy. This was
applied inwardly, and served to take the chill off.</p>

<p>Thus fortified&mdash;temperance people will please not be horrified
at this depravity of a nineteen-year-old novice, under such
extraordinary provocation&mdash;I worked around "Catfish" and followed
along the west shore as far as Lakeland. From Lakeland
across the lake to the Hudson levee, is about three-quarters of a
mile. It was still blowing a gale, and the rain came down in
torrents, so that the opposite shore could not be seen&mdash;in fact
one could not distinguish an object ten rods ahead. I had felt
my way along, sometimes under the "slow bell", until the present.
I must now cut loose from the west shore, and make the crossing
to Hudson. There was plenty of water everywhere; but I could
not see any landmarks on the opposite side of the lake. I got
a stern bearing, however, and headed across. In a minute's time
I could see nothing, either ahead or astern, and having no compass
I had to rely on the "feel" of the rudders to tell me which way
she was swinging. As it turned out, this was of little value,
owing to the strength of the wind. For five minutes I ran under
full head, and then slowed, trying to get a glimpse of the east
bank, and "find myself". When I did, the "H. S. Allen" was
headed squarely down the lake, and fully a mile below the Hudson
landing. The force of the wind on the chimneys had turned her
bow down-wind and downstream. As the rain began to slacken
and I could see my marks, it took but a few minutes to straighten
her up and make the run to the landing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
On leaving Hudson there were two ways of running the
big bar opposite and below the mouth of Willow River. One,
the longest, was to cross back to Lakeland and then run up the
west shore&mdash;all of it straight work. The other, was to run
squarely out into the middle of the lake, turn north and run
half a mile, then quartering west-north-west across the lake to
the opposite shore. This crossing saved a mile or more of steaming
over the other course; but it was crooked and narrow, and the
possibility of hanging up was much greater. Captain Gray asked
me, when backing out, which crossing I would make. I replied
that I was going to take the upper to save time. He said nothing,
but again took his place by the bell. He made no suggestion,
nor offered any opinion as to my decision. That was a part of
the river etiquette, which he adhered to even in the case of a
boy; for which I sincerely thanked him in my inner being, while
accepting it outwardly quite as a matter of course&mdash;which it
would have been, with an older and more experienced man at
the wheel.</p>

<p>I made the crossing without calling for leads, or touching
bottom, and the rest of the way was easy. When we made Stillwater
the stars were out, and the storm-clouds hung low on the
southern horizon. I went below and got into dry clothes, and
had a few hours sleep while the freight was being put ashore.
Along about two o'clock in the morning I started back, with
the mate on the roof. In confidence he confided to me the
gratifying news that the "old man says you're all right. He says
that you've got nerve enough to last you through". As "nerve"
was one of the things needed in the business, I was certainly
proud that my night's work, alone on a heavily-loaded boat, in
one of the worst of storms, had given me a standing with the "old
man"; and I felt reasonably certain that his report would carry
weight among the river men who might chance to discuss the
merits of the young "cub", and his equipment for serious work.</p>

<p>I may, I hope, be pardoned for dwelling at such length upon
an incident of such common occurrence on the river as to attract
little or no attention when the man at the wheel was an old
and experienced pilot. But this was my "trying-out" time, which
made a difference. Even if no one else ever gave the incident a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
second thought, I should have felt the shame of it to this day,
had I "craw-fished" on that first trial.</p>

<p>I have never seen or heard anything to compare with the
storms we used to have on the river. The river men had a
theory of their own&mdash;not very scientific, and probably without
foundation in fact&mdash;that the vapors from the lowlands and
islands formed clouds which were more than ordinarily charged
with electricity. <i>Why</i> they should be more highly charged than
vapors arising from lowlands or islands elsewhere, they did not
attempt to explain, and could not had they attempted. The fact
remains, that our thunder storms were something out of the
ordinary, and were so regarded by people from the East who
experienced them for the first time. Many steamboats were struck
by lightning, but few were burned, the electrical bolt being
diffused through the iron of the boilers and machinery, and finding
ready escape through the water-wheel shafts into the river. I have
heard it stated that engineers have often received serious shocks
from bolts thus passing from the chimneys to the water, by way
of the machinery, but I never heard of one being killed. I do
know that when these pyrotechnics were going on, the engineers
kept their hands off the throttle-wheel, except in cases of dire
necessity. The pilot was seemingly in more, but really less danger
than the engineers. However, under such circumstances, a man
had to hang on to his nerve as well as his wheel; and I doubt
if many pilots ever became so hardened as not to feel "creepy"
when the storm was on.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_14"></a>Chapter XIV<br />
<i>Early Pilots</i></h2>
</div>

<p>"How did the first steamboats find their way up the hundreds
of miles of water heretofore unbroken by steam-driven wheel?"
No voice out of the past will give an answer to this query. The
imagination of the trained pilot, however, needs no written page
to solve the problem of how it might have been done; and he
can picture to himself the satisfaction, akin to joy, of the man at
the wheel, picking his way amid the thousand islands and snag-infested
channels innumerable, guided only by his power to read
the face of the water, and his knowledge of the basic principles
that govern the flow of all great rivers. Standing thus at his
wheel, with new vistas of stream and wood and bluff opening to
him as he rounded each successive bend, choosing on the instant
the path as yet uncharted; unhampered by time-honored "landmarks",
with "all the world to choose from", none might be so
envied as he. But we will never know who had this pleasure all
his own.</p>

<p>In thus picturing the passage of pioneer steamboats up the
Mississippi, there is danger that we may inject into the scene
the image of the modern floating palace, with her three decks,
her tall chimneys, her massive side-wheels, her "Texas", and her
pilot house, fully equipped with spars, gang planks, jack staff, and
all the paraphernalia of the beautiful and speedy "packets" of our
day. Upon no such craft, however, did the early navigators pick
their way into the solitudes of the upper river. Their boats were
little better than the keel boats which they superseded&mdash;in fact
they were keel boats operated by steam. The cargo-box afforded
shelter for passengers, merchandise, and machinery. There was
no pilot house in which to stand, fifty feet above the water, from
that height to study the river bottom. The steersman stood at

the stern, and manipulated his tiller by main strength and awkwardness,
while the captain stood at the bow and studied the
river, and gave his orders to "port" or "starboard", as the case
required. As the boat drew less than three feet of water, the
necessity for fine judgment in choosing the channel was not as
necessary as in guiding a craft drawing twice as much. Nevertheless,
it did call for judgment and decision; and these qualities
were inherent in the men who made the navigation of Western
waters their occupation in the early decades of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>Long years before the advent of steam, the fur-traders of
the upper river were running their heavily-laden canoes, bateaux,
and Mackinac boats from St. Anthony Falls to Prairie du Chien,
and thence up the Wisconsin and down the Fox to Green Bay and
Mackinac; or, farther down the Mississippi to St. Louis. To
guide these boats, with their valuable cargoes of peltries, pilots
were as necessary as on the larger craft that later were to supersede
them. A man standing in the stern, with ready paddle in
hand, was the forerunner of the pilot of civilization. In his veins
the blood of sunny France mingled with that of a tawny mother
from Huron, Chippewa, or Dakota wigwams. His eye was quick
to read the dimpling waters, and his arm strong to turn the prow
of his craft aside from threatening snag or sand-bar.</p>

<p>The transition from bateaux paddle and sweep to the steamboat
wheel was not great, and it followed that the names of the
earliest recorded members of the profession are such as to leave
no room for doubt as to nationality or pedigree. Louis DeMarah
heads the list of upper Mississippi River pilots who handled
steamboats prior to 1836. There were steamers running between
St. Louis and Fort Snelling from the year 1823, with more or
less regularity. The "Virginia" (Captain Crawford) was the
first steamboat to reach Fort Snelling, May 10, 1823. While
we have the name of the captain, we have no mention of her
pilots and engineers. It is probable that the master did his own
piloting. Nearly all historical references to the early navigation
of the upper Mississippi or Missouri Rivers speak of the master
as also the pilot of his craft. Occasionally, however, we read of a
pilot, but do not learn his name, his office being his only individuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Lumbering operations had already begun on the Black, Chippewa,
and St. Croix Rivers prior to 1836, and pilots were in
demand to run the timber rafts down the river. No doubt DeMarah
began his professional life in this trade, if not in the
earlier life of the <i>voyageur</i>. He is mentioned as being an old
man in 1843, his home being then in Prairie du Chien, where,
in the census of Crawford County, in the new Territory of
Wisconsin, he is listed with a family of eight&mdash;probably a Chippewa
wife and seven "breeds" of varying attenuations. With
the phonetic freedom exercised by our forefathers, his name appears
as Louis "Demerer".</p>

<p>In connection with DeMarah's name there is associated in
the earliest annals of the river that of Louis Moro (or Morrow),
evidently a corruption of Moreau, a name not appearing on the
census roll of Crawford County. Evidently a <i>protégé</i> of DeMarah's,
he probably was taught the science of piloting by the
elder man, as the names are nearly always spoken of in connection.
Evidently they were partners, so far as that was possible in the
days when steamboats took but one pilot, running only by day,
and lying at the bank at night. Captain Russell Blakeley, who
began life on the river in the early '40's, speaks of these men as
the first who engaged in steamboat piloting as a business.</p>

<p>It may only be an accidental coincidence of names, and yet
it is more than possible that Louis Moreau, of Prairie du Chien
in 1836, was a descendant of the Pierre Moreau, the noted <i>courier
du bois</i>, and adventurous trader who befriended Father Marquette,
patron saint of Wisconsin, as he lay sick, slowly dying, in his
squalid hut on the portage between the Chicago River and the Des
Plaines, one hundred and fifty years earlier, as recorded in the
pages of Parkman's <i>La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West</i>.</p>

<p>Another of the earliest pilots was Pleasant Cormack, also
a Frenchman with possibly a slight dash of Indian blood in his composition.
He is in the records as an intelligent, trustworthy pilot,
and held the wheels of many of the largest and finest of upper
river boats during the flush times between 1850 and 1862.</p>

<p>DeMarah and Moreau were so far ahead of my generation
on the river, that I never saw either of them. My own acquaintance
with the half-breed pilot of tradition, was confined to the
person of Joe Guardapie, a St. Croix and Mississippi River raftsman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
He filled the bill completely, however, and having seen
and known him the type was fully identified. A lithe savage,
about five feet ten inches in height, and a hundred and sixty-five
or seventy pounds in weight, his color exhibited more of the
traits of his Chippewa mother than of his French father. In
facial expression, however, the mercurial disposition of his father's
kindred supplanted the stolidity of his Indian forbears. As quick
as a panther, and as strong in nerve and sinew, he could whip
any member of his crew, single-handed. In case of necessity he
could put to rout a dozen of them&mdash;else he could not have run
a raft to St. Louis; in fact, had it been otherwise he could not
have started a raft from the landing at Prescott. Several times he
made the return trip from below on our boat, taking cabin passage
while his crew went "deck passage". He loafed in the pilot house
most of the time on the up trip, as was the custom of the craft,
and occasionally took a trick at the wheel to relieve the regular
pilots. I never heard of his doing regular steamboat work, however,
his tastes and education tying him to rafting.</p>

<p>It was interesting to listen to his broken English, freely
mingled with borderland French, the whole seasoned with unmistakable
Anglo-Saxon profanity. It is curious to note that the
untutored Indian has no profanity at all; and that of the Frenchman
is of such mild-mannered texture as to be quite innocuous.
Any one acquainted with modern polite literature must have observed
that the French brand of profanity is used to flavor popular
novels treating of life in high society, and the <i>mon Dieus</i> and
<i>sacres</i> are not considered at all harmful reading, even for boarding
school misses. It follows that the Frenchman who wishes to lay
any emphasis upon his orders to a mixed crew of all nationalities&mdash;English,
Irish, Dutch, Yankee, and Norwegian, with a sprinkling
of French and Indian, must resort to Anglo-Saxon for effective
expressions. And even this must often be backed with a ready
fist or a heavy boot, properly to impress the fellow to whom it
is directed. Joe Guardapie had the whole arsenal with him, all
the time, largely accounting, I fancy, for his success as a raft pilot.</p>

<p>Another old-time raftsman was Sandy McPhail. He piloted
log and lumber rafts from the Chippewa to Prairie du Chien, and
further down, in the days when Jefferson Davis, as a lieutenant
in the regular army, was a member of the garrison at Fort Crawford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Whether "Sandy" was the name conferred upon him at
the baptismal font, or gratuitously bestowed by an appreciative
following on account of the color of his hair and beard, which
were unmistakably red, will never be known. He certainly had
no other name on the river. He was a good pilot, and a great
handler of men, as well, which made him a model raftsman. He
never took to the milder lines of steamboat piloting, so far as there
is any record to be found.</p>

<p>Still another was Charles LaPointe, who ran rafts from
the Chippewa to lower river ports prior to 1845&mdash;how much
earlier, it is now impossible to learn. He also was of the typical
French half-breed <i>voyageur</i> pioneers of the West, and handed
down a record as a competent navigator of rafts on the river when
it was almost unknown and entirely undeveloped.</p>

<p>When I was pantry boy on the "Kate Cassell", my first venture
aboard, we had a pilot picked up "above the lake", when we
started out in the spring, a raftsman named McCoy&mdash;J. B., I think
he signed himself. He was from Stillwater, and made but few
trips on the steamer before taking up his regular work in rafting. A
Scotchman, very quiet and reserved, so far as his deportment went
while on the "Kate Cassell", he had, nevertheless, the reputation
of being exceedingly handy with his fists when on his native sawlogs.
This reputation led to an impromptu prize fight, which
was "pulled off" at a woodyard near Hastings, Minnesota. A
St. Louis bruiser named Parker, who had fought several battles
on Bloody Island, opposite that city, was on board. Having heard
of McCoy's reputation as a fighter, he lost no opportunity to
banter and insult him, especially when he (Parker) was in liquor,
which was most of the time. This lasted for several days, from
Galena to Hastings, where it reached a climax. McCoy told him
he would settle it with him at the next woodpile, so that they
might not go into St. Paul with the question in doubt. When
the woodpile was reached the officers of the boat, with most of
the passengers, and as many of the crew as could abandon their
posts, adjourned to the woods a few rods from the landing. A
ring was roped off, seconds were chosen, and bottle-holders and
sponge-bearers detailed. The men stripped to their trousers and
went in. There was not as much science exhibited, probably, as
in some of our modern professional "mills", but there was plenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
of good, honest slugging. Both men were well punished, especially
about the head and face. So equally were they matched, that
neither suffered a knock-out, and when the bell struck for starting
they had to quit without either getting the decision. This happened
in the days when the Heenan-Sayre international bout was
one of the prime topics of public interest, and it was noticeable that
any number of our men were well enough posted in the rules of the
P. R. to serve as officials in all departments. McCoy lost no
caste among crew or passengers on account of this incident. There
were neither kid gloves nor silk stockings among the pioneers
who were pushing into Minnesota in 1856, and an incident of this
sort was diverting rather than deplorable.</p>

<p>Other pilots whose names appear very early in the annals
of steamboating on the upper river, and whose fame as masters of
the art will ever remain green among members of the craft so
long as pilots turn a wheel on the river, were William White,
Sam Harlow, Rufus Williams, George Nichols, Alex. Gody, and
Hugh White, all of whom appear to have been in service in
1850 or before. These were followed by John Arnold, Joseph
Armstrong, John King, Rufus Williams, Edward A. West, E.
V. Holcomb, Hiram Beadle, William Cupp, Jerome Smith,
William Fisher, Stephen Dalton, Jackson Harris, Henry Gilpatrick,
James Black, Thomas Burns, T. G. Dreming, Harry
Tripp, William Tibbles, Seth Moore, Stephen Hanks, Charley
Manning, Thomas Cushing, Peter Hall, and fifty others equally
as good. All of those named, served in the Minnesota Packet
Company in the days of its prosperity, some of them for many
years. All were experts in their profession, and some of them,
as "Ned" West and John King, were entitled to the highest
encomium known on the river&mdash;that of being "lightning pilots".</p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_15"></a>Chapter XV<br />
<i>Incidents of River Life</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Captain William Fisher, of Galena, Illinois, is probably
the oldest living pilot of the upper Mississippi. At the time of
this writing (1908), he is spending the closing years of his life
in quiet comfort in a spot where he can look down upon the
waters of "Fevre" River, once alive with steamboats, in the
pilot houses of which he spent over thirty years in hard and
perilous service.</p>

<p>As a young man Captain Fisher had served five years on
the Great Lakes on a "square rigger", at a time when full-rigged
ships sailed the inland waters. Coming to Galena just as the
great boom in steamboating commenced, and following the opening
of Minnesota Territory to settlement, he naturally gravitated
toward the life of a steamboatman, taking his first lessons in
piloting in 1852, on the "Ben Campbell", under the tutelage
of Captain M. W. Lodwick. The next season (1853), he
worked on the "War Eagle", under William White and John
King, two of the best pilots on the upper river. Under their
teaching he soon obtained his license, and henceforth for thirty
years he piloted many of the finest boats running between St. Louis
and St. Paul. His crowning achievement was the taking of the
"City of Quincy" from St. Louis to St. Paul, Captain Brock
being his partner for the trip. The "City of Quincy" was a
New Orleans packet, that had been chartered to take an excursion
the length of the river. Of sixteen hundred tons burden, with
a length of three hundred feet and fifty feet beam, she was the
largest boat ever making the trip above Keokuk Rapids.</p>

<p>Two or three incidents of his river life, among the many
which he relates, are of interest as showing the dangers of that
life. One, which he believes was an omen prophetic of the War
of Secession, he relates as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
"I'm going to tell you this just as it happened. I don't
know whether you will believe me or not. I don't say that I
would believe it if I had not seen it with my own eyes. If some
one else had told it to me, I might have set it down as a 'yarn'.
If they have never had any experiences on the river, some men
would make yarns to order; it is a mighty sight easier to make
them than it is to live them&mdash;and safer.</p>

<p>"When this thing happened to me, I was entirely sober,
and I was not asleep. If you will take my word for it, I have
never been anything else but sober. If I had been otherwise,
I would not be here now, telling you this, and eighty-two years
old.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"Whiskey always gets 'em before they see the eighty mark.
And you know that a man can't run a steamboat while asleep&mdash;that
is, very long. Of course he can for a little while, but when
she hits the bank it wakes him up.</p>

<p>"This story ought to interest you, because I was on your
favorite boat when it happened. The "Fanny Harris" was sold
in 1859, in May or June, to go South. She came back right
away, not going below St. Louis, after all. I took her down
to that port. Joseph Jones of Galena had just bought the bar for
the season when she was sold, and lost thirty dollars in money
by the boat being sold.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Captain W. H. Gabbert was in command, and I was
pilot. We left Galena in the evening. It was between changes
of the moon, and a beautiful starlight night&mdash;as fine as I ever
saw. By the time we got down to Bellevue, the stars had all
disappeared, and it had become daylight, not twilight, but broad
daylight, so bright that you couldn't see even the brightest star,
and from 11:30 to 12:30, a full hour, it was as bright as any
day you ever saw when the sun was under a cloud. At midnight
I was right opposite Savanna. Up to this time Captain Gabbert
had been asleep in the cabin, although he was on watch. We
were carrying neither passengers nor freight, for we were just
taking the boat down to deliver her to her new owners. He
woke up, or was called, and when he saw the broad daylight,
yet saw by his watch that it was just midnight, he was surprised,
and maybe scared, just as every one else was. He
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
ran up on to the roof and called out: 'Mr. Fisher, land the boat, the world
is coming to an end'!</p>

<p>"I told him that if the world were coming to an end we
might as well go in the middle of the river as at the bank, and
I kept her going. It took just as long to get dark again as it took
to get light&mdash;about half an hour. It began to get light at
half-past eleven, and at twelve (midnight) it was broad daylight;
then in another half hour it was all gone, and the stars had come
out one by one, just as you see them at sunset&mdash;the big, bright
ones first, and then the whole field of little ones. I looked for
all the stars I knew by sight, and as they came back, one by one,
I began to feel more confidence in the reality of things. I couldn't
tell at all where the light came from; but it grew absolutely
broad daylight. That one hour's experience had more to do
with turning my hair white than anything that ever occurred to
me, for it certainly did seem a strange phenomenon."</p>

<p>"Was it worse than going into battle?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, a hundred times worse, because it was different. When
you go into battle you know just what the danger is, and you
nerve yourself up to meet it. It is just the same as bracing up
to meet any known danger in your work&mdash;wind, lightning, storm.
You know what to expect, and if you have any nerve you just
hold yourself in and let it come. This was different. You didn't
know what was coming next; but I guess we all thought just as
the Captain did, that it was the end of the world.</p>

<p>"I confess that I was scared, but I had the boat to look
out for, and until the world really did come to an end I was
responsible for her, and so stood by, and you know that helps to
keep your nerves where they belong. I just hung on to the wheel
and kept her in the river, but I kept one eye on the eastern sky
to see what was coming next. I hope when my time comes I shall
not be scared to death, and I don't believe I shall be. It will
come in a natural way, and there won't be anything to scare
a man. It is the unknown and the mysterious that shakes him,
and this midnight marvel was too much for any of us. We had
a great many signs before the war came, and I believe this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
marvel on the night in question, was one of them, only we didn't
know how to read it."</p>

<p>"How about the narrow escapes, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have had a number of them. In 1871 I was running
a towboat with coal barges. Twelve miles below Rock
Island, we were struck by a cyclone. It took the cabin clean
off the boat, and of course the pilot house went with it. My
partner was with me in the pilot house, having seen the storm
coming up, with heavy wind, so he came up to help me keep
her in the river. At this time we were pushing a lumber raft
downstream. Both of us were blown into the river. My partner
got hold of the raft and pulled himself out, but I went under
it. I thought that it was the end of piloting; but Providence
was with me. I came up through an aperture where four cribs
of lumber cornered&mdash;a little hole not over three feet square.
My partner saw me and ran and pulled me out, and we both
got back on the dismantled hull of our boat. I could not have
helped myself, as I was too near strangled. The force of the
cyclone must have stopped the current of the river for the time
or I would never have come up where I did. The shock and
the wetting laid me up for six weeks.</p>

<p>"When I was able to resume work, Dan Rice happened to
come along with his circus boat. He wanted a pilot to take
his craft not only up the great river, but also, so far as possible,
up such tributaries as were navigable, he wishing to give exhibitions
at all the towns alongshore. I shipped with him for $300 a month
and had an easy time during the rest of the season, running nights,
mostly, and laying up daytimes while the show was exhibiting.</p>

<p>"The next year I was engaged on the "Alex. Mitchell." We
had left St. Paul at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, on Saturday, May
6, 1872. I am particular about this day and date, for the point
of this story hinges on the day of the week (Sunday). In trying
to run the Hastings bridge we were struck by a squall that threw
us against the abutment, tearing off a portion of our starboard
guard. We arrived at La Crosse, Sunday morning, and took
on two hundred excursionists for Lansing. They wanted to
dance, but it being Sunday Captain Laughton hesitated for some
time about giving them permission, as it was contrary to the
known wishes, if not the rules, of Commodore Davidson to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
dancing or games on board of his boats on Sunday. The passengers
were persistent, however, and at last Captain Laughton
yielded, saying that he couldn't help it! Of course he might have
helped it. What is a captain for, if not to run his boat, no
matter if everybody else is against him? That was where he
was weak. He finally yielded, however, and they danced all
the way to Lansing. When we arrived there it was raining,
and the excursionists chartered the boat for a run back to Victory,
about ten miles, and they were dancing all the time.</p>

<p>"Leaving them at Victory we proceeded on our way down
the river. When about twelve miles above Dubuque, a little
below Wells's Landing, at three o'clock Monday morning, we
were struck by a cyclone. We lost both chimneys, the pilot house
was unroofed, and part of the hurricane deck on the port side
was blown off. Mr. Trudell, the mate, was on watch, and standing
on the roof by the big bell. He was blown off, and landed
on shore a quarter of a mile away, but sustained no serious
injuries. The port lifeboat was blown a mile and a half into
the country. Following so soon after the Sunday dancing, I
have always felt that there was some connection between the two."</p>

<p>Captain Fisher is a very conscientious man&mdash;a religious man,
and he believes in observing Sunday&mdash;that is, keeping it as nearly
as is possible on a steamboat running seven days in the week. The
dancing was wholly unnecessary, if not in itself immoral, and
its permission by Captain Laughton was in direct contravention
of the known wishes if not orders of the owners. Hence the
conclusion that Providence took a hand in the matter and meted
out swift punishment for the misdoing. I did not argue the matter
with the Captain; but I could not reconcile the unroofing of Commodore
Davidson's steamboat, or the blowing away of Mr. Trudell,
who had no voice in granting license to the ungodly dancers, with
the ordinary conception of the eternal fitness of things. If it
had blown Captain Laughton a mile and a half into the country,
as it did the port lifeboat, or even a quarter of a mile, as it
did Mr. Trudell, and had left Commodore Davidson's steamboat
intact, the hand of Providence would have appeared more plainly
in the case. As it was, Captain Laughton slept serenely in his
berth while Mr. Trudell and the lifeboat were sailing into space,
and he did not get out until all was over. It is pleasant to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
able to relate that although Providence appears to have miscarried
in dealing out retribution, Commodore Davidson did not. Captain
Davis was put in charge of the "Alex. Mitchell" as soon as
she struck the levee at St. Louis.</p>

<p>William F. Davidson&mdash;"Commodore", from the fact that
he was at the head of the greatest of upper river packet lines&mdash;had
been converted after many years of strenuous river life. He
was as strong a man, affirmatively, after he began living religiously,
as he had been negatively before that time. He abolished all
bars from his steamboats, at great pecuniary loss to himself and
the other stockholders; forbade Sunday dancing and other forms
of Sunday desecration; stopped all gambling, and instituted other
reforms which tended to make his steamboats as clean and reputable
as the most refined ladies or gentlemen could wish. The
promptitude with which he cashiered Captain Laughton, on account
of the foregoing incident, was in keeping with his character
as a man and as a manager. It was an evidence that he meant all
that he said or ordered in the ethical conduct of his steamboats.</p>

<p>The Commodore had a brother, Payton S. Davidson, who had
the well-earned reputation of being one of the best steamboatmen
on the Mississippi. Superintendent of the Northwestern Line,
he prided himself upon the regularity with which his boats arrived
at or departed from landings on schedule time. He was a driver,
and the captains and pilots who could not "make time" under any
and all conditions of navigation, were <i>persona non grata</i> to "Pate",
and when they reached this stage they went ashore with scant
notice. In other ways he was equally efficient.</p>

<p>One of the Northwestern Line, the "Centennial", was caught
in the great ice gorge at St. Louis, in 1876. She was a new
boat, costing $65,000, just off the ways, and a beauty. She was
stove and sank, as did a dozen other boats at the same time. All
the others were turned over to the underwriters as they lay, and
were a total loss. Not so the "Centennial". Superintendent
Payton S. Davidson was on hand and declared that the beautiful
new boat could and should be raised. Putting on a force of
men&mdash;divers, wreckers, and other experts&mdash;under his personal
supervision and direction, he did get her afloat, although in a badly
damaged condition, and that at a cost of only $5,000. Twice
she sank, after being brought to the surface; but the indomitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
energy of Davidson, who worked night and day, sometimes in
the water up to his middle, and in floating ice, finally saved the
steamer. She was one of the finest boats that ever plied the
upper river. Payton S. was famous for his pugnacity as well
as his pertinacity, and there is no record of his repentance or
conversion. He lived and died a typical steamboat captain of
the olden time.</p>

<i>Mississippi Menus</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a saying on the river that if you wished to save
the meals a passenger was entitled to on his trip, you took him
through the kitchen the first thing when he came aboard. The
inference was, that after seeing the food in course of preparation
he would give it a wide berth when it came on the table. It
would be unfair to the memory of the average river steward to
aver that this assertion was grounded upon facts; but it would
be stretching the truth to assert that it was without foundation.
Things must be done in a hurry when three meals a day are to
be prepared and served to three or four hundred people; and
all the work had to be accomplished in two kitchens, each ten
by twenty-feet in area&mdash;one for meats and vegetables, and the
other for pastry and desserts.</p>

<p>The responsibility of providing for meals at stated times,
with a good variety, cooked and served in a satisfactory manner,
devolved upon the steward. Under him were two assistants,
with meat cooks, vegetable cooks, pastry cooks, and bread makers,
and a force of waiters and pantrymen conditioned upon the boat's
capacity for passengers. While the steward was in the thought
of outsiders rated as an officer of the second class, he was as a
matter of fact in the first class. When the pay of the captain
was three hundred dollars per month, and that of the mate two
hundred, the average steward of any reputation also commanded
two hundred, while a man with a large reputation commanded
three hundred, the same as the captain, and his services were
sought by the owners of a dozen boats. Likewise, he earned
every cent of his salary, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>Unlike the other officers he had no regular watch to stand,
after which he might lay aside his responsibility and let the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
members of the other watch carry the load while he laid off and
watched them sweat. He was on duty all the time, and when
and how he slept is to this day a mystery to me. He might have
slept in the morning, when the cooks were preparing breakfast,
had he felt quite confident that the cooks were not likewise
sleeping, instead of broiling beefsteaks and making waffles. This
being a matter of some doubt, and of great concern, he was usually
up as soon as the cooks, and quietly poking about to see that
breakfast reached the table promptly at seven o'clock. If the
floor of the cabin was covered with sleepers, it was the steward
who must awaken them, and, without giving offense, induce them
to vacate the premises that the tables might be set. This was
a delicate piece of business. To send a "nigger" to perform that
duty, would be to incur the risk of losing the "nigger". The
steward also saw that the assistant in charge of the waiters was
on hand with all his crew, to put the cabin to rights, set the tables,
and prepare to serve breakfast, while the cabin steward and the
stewardess, with their crews, were making up the berths, sweeping,
dusting, and "tidying up".</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was out of the way, the menu for dinner
was prepared and handed to the chief cook. Shortages in provisions
were remedied at the first landing reached, and stocks of
fish, game, fresh eggs, and fresh vegetables were bought as offered
at the various towns. While there was a cold-storage room on
all first-class packets, its capacity was limited, and with a passenger
list of two hundred and fifty or three hundred in the cabin, it
was often found necessary to lay in additional stocks of fresh
meats between Galena and St. Paul. Often, a dozen lambs could
be picked up, or a dozen "roaster" pigs, and these were killed
and dressed on the boat by one of the assistant cooks. Live poultry
was always carried in coops, and killed as wanted. Perhaps the
poultry killing, if witnessed by the passenger, would come as
near curing him of the dinner habit as anything else he might see
about the cook's galley. A barrel of scalding hot water, drawn
from the boiler, stands on the guard. A coop of chickens is
placed near the master of ceremonies, and two or three assistants
surround the barrel. The head dresser grasps a chicken by the
head, gives it a swing from the coop to the barrel, bringing the
chicken's neck on to the iron rim of the barrel. The body goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
into hot water and the head goes overboard. Before the chicken
is dead he is stripped of everything except a few pin feathers&mdash;with
one sweep of the hand on each side of the body and a dozen
pulls at the wing feathers. The yet jerking, featherless bodies
are thrown to the pin-feather man, who picks out the thickest
of the feathers, singes the fowls over a charcoal grate-fire and
tosses them to one of the under-cooks who cuts them open, cuts
them up, and pots them, all inside of two minutes from the coop.
A team of three or four expert darkies will dispose of one hundred
and fifty chickens in an hour. Are they clean? I never stopped
to inquire. If they were <i>dead</i> enough to stay on the platter when
they got to the table that was all any reasonable steamboatman
could ask.</p>

<p>However, the live chicken business is about the worst feature
of the cook-house operations. Of course the darkies are not the
cleanest-appearing people aboard the boat, but if the steward is
up in his business he sees to it that a reasonable degree of cleanliness
is maintained, even in the starboard galley. On the opposite
side of the steamer is the pastry-cook's domain, and that is usually
the show place of the boat. Most stewards are shrewd enough
to employ pastry cooks who are masters of their profession, men
who take a pride not only in the excellence of their bread, biscuit,
and pie crust, but also in the spotlessness of their workshops.
They are proud to receive visits from the lady passengers, who
can appreciate not only the output but the appearance of the
galley. It is a good advertisement for a boat, and the steward
himself encourages such visits, while discouraging like calls at
the opposite side.</p>

<p>In old, flush times in the steamboat business, pastry cooks
generally planned to give a surprise to the passengers on each
up trip of the steamer. I remember one such, when no less than
thirteen different desserts were placed in front of each passenger
as he finished the hearty preliminary meal. Six of these were
served in tall and slender glass goblets&mdash;vases, would more nearly
describe them&mdash;and consisted of custards, jellies, and creams
of various shades and flavors; while the other seven were pies,
puddings, and ice creams. The passenger was not given a menu
card and asked to pick out those that he thought he would like,
but the whole were brought on and arranged in a circle about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
his plate, leaving him to dip into each as he fancied, and leave
such as did not meet his approval. It was necessary to carry
an extra outfit of glass and china in order to serve this bewildering
exhibition of the pastry cook's art, and it was seldom used more
than once on each trip.</p>

<p>Serving such a variety of delicacies, of which but a small
portion was eaten by any person at the table, would seem like
an inexcusable waste; but the waste on river steamers was really
not as great in those days as it is in any great hotel of our day.
Each steamer carried forty or more deck hands and "rousters".
For them, the broken meat was piled into pans, all sorts in each
pan, the broken bread and cake into other pans, and jellies and
custards into still others&mdash;just three assortments, and this, with
plenty of boiled potatoes, constituted the fare of the crew below
decks. One minute after the cry of "Grub-pile"! one might witness
the spectacle of forty men sitting on the bare deck, clawing
into the various pans to get hold of the fragments of meat or
cake which each man's taste particularly fancied. It certainly
wasn't an appetizing spectacle. Only familiarity with it enabled
an onlooker fully to appreciate its grotesqueness without allowing
the equilibrium of his stomach to be disturbed. It usually had but
one effect upon such lady passengers as had the hardihood to
follow the cry of "Grub-pile"! and ascertain what the thing
really was.</p>

<p>Altogether the duties of the steward were arduous and tormenting.
The passengers expected much; and after getting the
best, if any slip occurred they were sure to enter complaint&mdash;a
complaint so worded as to convey the impression that they never
had anything fit to eat while on the boat, nor any service that
white men were justified in tolerating. The fact was, that most
of the passengers so served had never in all their lives lived so
well as they did on the trip from Galena to St. Paul on one of
the regular boats of the Minnesota Packet Company. Certainly,
after reaching their destination in the Territory of Minnesota,
the chances were that it would be many long years, in that era
of beginnings, before they would again be so well fed and so
assiduously cared for, even in the very best hotels of St. Paul.</p>

<p>This chapter on Mississippi menus would be incomplete without
some reference to the drinkables served on the steamboat tables.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
These were coffee, tea, and river water. Mark Twain has
described the ordinary beverage used on the river, as it is found
on the Missouri, or on the Mississippi below the mouth of the
"Big Muddy":</p>

<div class="blockquote2">

<p>"When I went up to my room, I found there the young man called
Rogers, crying. Rogers was not his name; neither was Jones, Brown,
Baxter, Ferguson, Bascom, nor Thompson; but he answered to either of
them that a body found handy in an emergency; or to any other name,
in fact, if he perceived that you meant him. He said:</p>

<p>"'What is a person to do here when he wants a drink of water? drink
this slush?'</p>

<p>"'Can't you drink it?'</p>

<p>"'I would if I had some other water to wash it with.'</p>

<p>"Here was a thing which had not changed; a score of years had not
affected this water's mulatto complexion in the least; a score of centuries
would succeed no better, perhaps. It comes out of the turbulent bank-caving
Missouri, and every tumblerful of it holds nearly an acre of land
in solution. I got this fact from the bishop of the diocese. If you will
let your glass stand half an hour, you can separate the land from the
water as easy as Genesis; and then you will find them both good; the
one good to eat, the other good to drink. The land is very nourishing,
the water is thoroughly wholesome. The one appeases hunger, the other,
thirst. But the natives do not take them separately, but together, as
nature mixed them. When they find an inch of mud in the bottom of
the glass, they stir it up, and then take the draught as they would gruel.
It is difficult for a stranger to get used to this batter, but once used to it
he will prefer it to water. This is really the case. It is good for steamboating,
and good to drink; but it is worthless for all other purposes,
except baptizing."</p>
</div>

<p>The above sketch had not been written in 1860, as Mark
Twain was himself piloting on the lower river at that time. It
could not, therefore, have been this description which prejudiced
many eastern people against Mississippi River water as a beverage.
But that prejudice did exist, away back in the fifties, and the
fame of the yellow tipple had reached even to the fastnesses of
the Vermont hills at that early day. Many emigrants from the
old New England states provided themselves with kegs, jugs or
"demijohns", and before embarking at Rock Island or Dunleith
for the river trip, would fill these receptacles with water from
the nearest well, or even cistern, and drink such stuff, warm,
and sometimes putrid, rather than drink the life-giving elixir
which had welled up from springs nestled in the shadows of the
everlasting hills, or had been distilled by the sun from the snowbanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and ice fields of the unspoiled prairies and azure lakes
of the great northwest.</p>

<p>One old Yankee would pin his faith to nothing less than the
water from his own spring or well at home, away back in old
Vermont, and brought, at infinite pains and labor, a five-gallon
demijohn all the way from his native state, drinking it on the
cars en route, and on the boat after reaching the river.</p>

<p>It wasn't as bad as that. The river water was as pure and
healthful as any water on the footstool&mdash;<i>then</i>. It may not be
so now&mdash;it <i>isn't, now</i>. Then there were no great cities on the
river banks, pouring thousands of gallons of sewage and all manner
of corruption into the stream, daily. There was very little land
under cultivation even, and few farmyards, the drainage from
which might contaminate the feeders of the great river. It was
good, clean, healthful, spring and snow water. Above the mouth
of the Missouri, in any ordinary stage of water, especially with
a falling river, the water was but slightly discolored with the
yellow sediment with which the river itself is always tinged; and
this sediment was so fine that there was no suspicion of grit about
it. When properly stirred up and evenly mixed, as those to the
manner born always took it, it was an invigorating potion, and
like good old Bohea, it would cheer but not inebriate.</p>

<p>Since the advent of sewage in the river and with it the
popular superstition that everything, liquid or solid, is permeated
with pernicious microbes, it is possible that it has lost something
of its pristine purity, and it is certain that it has lost something
of its reputation; but river men still drink it from preference,
and passengers, unless they revert to the Yankee method, must
drink it perforce, or go dry.</p>

<i>Bars and Barkeepers</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In the old days on the river, whiskey was not classed as
one of the luxuries. It was regarded as one of the necessities,
if not the prime necessity, of life. To say that everybody drank
would not be putting much strain upon the truth, for the exceptions
were so few as scarcely to be worth counting. It was a
saying on the river that if a man owned a bar on a popular
packet, it was better than possessing a gold mine. The income
was ample and certain, and the risk and labor slight. Men who
owned life leases of steamboat bars willed the same to their
sons, as their richest legacies. Ingenious and far-seeing men set
about accumulating bars as other men invested in two, three, or
four banks, or factories.</p>

<p>"Billy" Henderson of St. Louis was the first financier to
become a trust magnate in bars. He owned the one on the
"Excelsior", on which boat he ran between St. Louis and St.
Paul. Later, he bought the lease of the bar on the "Metropolitan",
and still later, when the Northern Line was organized,
he bought the bars on all the boats, putting trusty "bar-keeps"
aboard each, he himself keeping a general oversight of the whole,
and rigorously exacting a mean average of returns from each,
based upon the number of passengers carried. This system of
averages included men, women, and children, and "Indians not
taxed", presupposing that a certain percentage of the passengers'
money would find its way into his tills, regardless of age, sex, or
color. What his judgment would have been had one of the craft
been chartered to carry a Sunday school picnic from St. Louis
to St. Paul, will never be known. Such an exigency never confronted
him, in those days. The judgment rendered was, that
he was not far off in his conclusions as to the average income
from the average class of passengers carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Ordinarily, the bartenders were young men "of parts". None
of them, so far as I know, were college graduates; but then
college graduates were then mighty few in the West in any calling&mdash;and
there were bars in plenty. It was required by their
employers that they be pleasant and agreeable fellows, well dressed,
and well mannered. They must know how to concoct a few of
the more commonplace fancy drinks affected by the small number
of travellers who wished such beverage&mdash;whiskey cocktails for the
Eastern trade, and mint juleps for the Southern. The plain,
everyday Western man took his whiskey straight, four fingers
deep, and seldom spoiled the effect of his drink by pouring water
on top of it. The "chaser" had not, at that early day, become
fashionable, and in times of extreme low water it was not permitted
that water should be wasted in that manner when all
was required for purposes of navigation.</p>

<p>The barkeeper was also supposed to know how to manufacture
a choice brand of French brandy, by the judicious admixture of
burnt peach stones, nitric acid, and cod-liver oil, superimposed
upon a foundation of Kentucky whiskey three weeks from the
still. He did it, too; but judicious drinkers again took theirs
straight, and lived the longest.</p>

<p>I flatter myself that I can recall the name of but one bartender
with whom I sailed. While I had no very strong scruples about
drinking or selling liquor, I seldom patronized the bar beyond
the purchase of cigars and an occasional soft drink. I remember
one dispenser, however, from his short but exceedingly stormy
experience on the "Fanny Harris". He was an Irish lad, about
twenty or twenty-one years of age, and not very large. He was
sent on board by the lessee of the bar, who lived in Dubuque.</p>

<p>Charley Hargus, our chief clerk, did not like the Irish. He
had personal reasons for disliking some member of that nationality,
and this dislike he handed on to all its other members with whom
he came in contact. There were no Irishmen among the officers
of the "Fanny Harris", and when Donnelly came aboard to take
charge of the bar Hargus strongly objected, but without avail.
He then set himself about the task of making life so uncomfortable
for the lad that he would be sure to transfer to some other boat,
or quit altogether, an end accomplished within three months. The
process afforded rare amusement to such witnesses as happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
to see the fun, but there was no fun in it for Donnelly; and in
later years, when I came to think it over, my sympathy went
out to the poor fellow, who suffered numberless indignities at the
hands of his tireless persecutor. If Donnelly&mdash;who was not at
all a bad fellow, was earning his living honestly, and never did
anything to injure Hargus&mdash;had had the spirit common to most
river men in those days, he would have shot the chief clerk and
few could have blamed him.</p>

<p>Bars are not looked upon with the same favor in our day,
as in the past. It is claimed that upon some of the boats plying
upon the upper river there are now no bars at all. If a person
thinks he must have liquor on the trip, he must take it with his
baggage. It is further credibly asserted that many of the officers
handling the steamers are teetotalers; further, that there is no
more profit in the bar business, and that investors in that kind
of property are becoming scarce. Modern business conditions are
responsible for much of the change that has taken place, especially
in the transportation business, within the last twenty-five years.
Railroad and steamboat managers do not care to intrust their
property to the care of drinking men, and it is becoming more
and more difficult for such to secure positions of responsibility.
As the display of liquor in an open bar might be a temptation to
some men, otherwise competent and trusty officers, the owners
are adopting the only consistent course, and are banishing the
bar from their boats.</p>

<p>This does not apply in all cases, however. A few years ago
I took a trip from St. Paul to St. Louis on one of the boats of
the Diamond Jo Line. There was a bar on the boat, but it
seemed to depend for its patronage upon the colored deck crew.
They were pretty constant patrons, although their drinking was
systematically regulated. A side window, opening out upon the
boiler deck promenade, was devoted to the deck traffic. If a
rouster wanted a drink he must apply to one of the mates, who
issued a brass check, good for a glass of whiskey, which the deck
hand presented at the bar, and got his drink. When pay day
came, the barkeeper in his turn presented his bundle of checks
and took in the cash. How many checks were issued to each
man on the trip from St. Louis to St. Paul and return, I do not
know; but it is safe to say that the sum total was not permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
to exceed the amount of wages due the rouster. Some of the
"niggers" probably had coming to them more checks than cash,
at the close of the voyage. The regulation was effective in preventing
excess, which would demoralize the men and render them
less valuable in "humping" freight.</p>

<p>The bartender always poured out the whiskey for the "coons",
and for the latter it was not a big drink. It was, likewise, not
a good drink for a white man, being a pretty tough article of
made-up stuff, that would burn a hole in a sheet-iron stove. If
it had been less fiery the rousters would have thought they were
being cheated.</p>

<p>While on this trip, I never saw an officer of the boat take
a drink at the bar, or anywhere else, and but few of the passengers
patronized it. It accentuated as much as any other one thing
the fact that the "good old times" on the river were gone, and
that a higher civilization had arisen. But peddling cheap whiskey
to "niggers"! What would an old-time bartender have thought
of that? The bare insinuation would have thrown him into a
fit. But we are all on an equality now, black and white&mdash;before
the bar.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_18"></a>Chapter XVIII<br />
<i>Gamblers and Gambling</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Volumes have been written, first and last, on the subject of
gambling on the Mississippi. In them a small fraction of truth
is diluted with a deal of fiction. The scene is invariably laid
upon a steamboat on the lower Mississippi. The infatuated
planter, who always does duty as the plucked goose, invariably
stakes his faithful body servant, or a beautiful quadroon girl,
against the gambler's pile of gold, and as invariably loses his
stake. Possibly that may occasionally have happened on the lower
river in ante-bellum days. I never travelled the lower river,
and cannot therefore speak from actual observation.</p>

<p>On the upper river, in early times, there were no nabobs
travelling with body servants and pretty quadroons. Most of the
travellers had broad belts around their waists, filled with good
honest twenty-dollar gold pieces. It was these belts which the
professional gamblers sought to lighten. Occasionally they did
strike a fool who thought he knew more about cards than the
man who made the game, and who would, after a generous baiting
with mixed drinks, "set in" and try his fortune. There was,
of course, but one result&mdash;the belt was lightened, more or less,
according to the temper and judgment of the victim.</p>

<p>So far as I know, gambling was permitted on all boats. On
some, there was a cautionary sign displayed, stating that gentlemen
who played cards for money did so at their own risk. The
professionals who travelled the river for the purpose of "skinning
suckers" were usually the "gentlemen" who displayed the greatest
concern in regard to the meaning of this caution, and who freely
expressed themselves in the hearing of all to the effect that they
seldom played cards at all, still less for money; but if they did
feel inclined to have a little social game it was not the business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of the boat to question their right to do so, and if they lost their
money they certainly would not call on the boat to restore it.</p>

<p>After the expression of such manly sentiments, it was surprising
if they did not soon find others who shared with them
this independence. In order to convey a merited reproof to
"the boat", for its unwarranted interference with the pleasure
or habits of its patrons, they bought a pack of cards at the bar
and "set in" to a "friendly game". In the posting of this inconspicuous
little placard, "the boat" no doubt absolved itself from all
responsibility in what might, and surely did follow in the "friendly
games" sooner or later started in the forward cabin. Whether
the placard likewise absolved the officers of the boat from all
responsibility in the matter, is a question for the logicians. I
cannot recollect that I had a conscience in those days; and if a
"sucker" chose to invest his money in draw poker rather than in
corner lots, it was none of my business. In that respect, indeed,
there was little choice between "Bill" Mallen on the boat with
his marked cards, and Ingenuous Doemly at Nininger, with his
city lots on paper selling at a thousand dollars each, which to-day,
after half a century, are possibly worth twenty-five dollars an
acre as farming land.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the play was not high on the upper river. The
passengers were not great planters, with sacks of money, and
"niggers" on the side to fall back upon in case of a bluff. The
operators, also, were not so greedy as their real or fictitious fellows
of the lower river. If they could pick up two or three hundred
dollars a week by honest endeavor they were satisfied, and gave
thanks accordingly.</p>

<p>Probably by some understanding among themselves, the fraternity
divided themselves among the different boats running
regularly in the passenger trade, and only upon agreement did
they change their boats; nor did they intrude upon the particular
hunting ground of others.</p>

<p>The "Fanny Harris" was favored with the presence, more
or less intermittently, of "Bill" Mallen, "Bill" and "Sam" Dove,
and "Boney" Trader. "Boney" was short for Napoleon Bonaparte.
These worthies usually travelled in pairs, the two Dove
brothers faithfully and fraternally standing by each other, while
Mallen and "Boney" campaigned in partnership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
These men were consummate actors. They never came aboard
the boat together, and they never recognized each other until
introduced&mdash;generally through the good offices of their intended
victims. In the preliminary stages of the game, they cheerfully
lost large sums of money to each other; and after the hunt was
up, one usually went ashore at Prescott, Hastings, or Stillwater,
while the other continued on to St. Paul. At different times they
represented all sorts and conditions of men&mdash;settlers, prospectors,
Indian agents, merchants, lumbermen, and even lumber-jacks; and
they always dressed their part, and talked it, too. To do this
required some education, keen powers of observation, and an all-around
knowledge of men and things. They were gentlemanly
at all times&mdash;courteous to men and chivalrous to women. While
pretending to drink large quantities of very strong liquors,
they did in fact make away with many pint measures of quite
innocent river water, tinted with the mildest liquid distillation
of burned peaches. A clear head and steady nerves were prerequisites
to success; and when engaged in business, these men
knew that neither one nor the other came by way of "Patsey"
Donnelly's "Choice wines and liquors". They kept their private
bottles of colored water on tap in the bar, and with the uninitiated
passed for heavy drinkers.</p>

<p>The play was generally for light stakes, but it sometimes ran
high. Five dollars ante, and no limit, afforded ample scope for
big play, provided the players had the money and the nerve.
The tables were always surrounded by a crowd of lookers-on,
most of whom knew enough of the game to follow it understandingly.
It is possible that some of the bystanders may have had
a good understanding with the professionals, and have materially
assisted them by signs and signals.</p>

<p>The chief reliance of the gamblers, however, lay in the
marked cards with which they played. No pack of cards left
the bar until it had passed through the hands of the gambler who
patronized the particular boat that he "worked". The marking
was called "stripping". This was done by placing the high cards&mdash;ace,
king, queen, jack, and ten-spot&mdash;between two thin sheets
of metal, the edges of which were very slightly concaved. Both
edges of the cards were trimmed to these edges with a razor; the
cards so "stripped" were thus a shade narrower in the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
than those not operated upon; they were left full width at each
end. The acutely sensitive fingers of the gamblers could distinguish
between the marked and the unmarked cards, while the
other players could detect nothing out of the way in them. "Bill"
Mallen would take a gross of cards from the bar to his stateroom
and spend hours in thus trimming them, after which they were
returned to the original wrappers, which were carefully folded and
sealed, and replaced in the bar for sale. A "new pack" was
often called for by the victim when "luck" ran against him;
and Mallen himself would ostentatiously demand a fresh pack
if he lost a hand or two, as he always did at the beginning of the
play.</p>

<p>I never saw any shooting over a game, and but once saw
pistols drawn. That was when the two Doves were holding
up a "tenderfoot". There was a big pile of gold on the table&mdash;several
hundred dollars in ten and twenty dollar pieces. The
losers raised a row and would have smashed the two operators
but for the soothing influence of a cocked Derringer in the hands
of one of them. The table was upset and the money rolled in
all directions. The outsiders decided where the money justly
belonged, in their opinion, by promptly pocketing all they could
reach while the principals were fighting. I found a twenty myself
the next morning.</p>

<p>I saw "Bill" Mallen for the last time under rather peculiar
and unlooked-for circumstances. It was down in Virginia, in
the early spring of 1865. There was a review of troops near
Petersburg, preparatory to the advance on Lee's lines. General
O. B. Wilcox and General Sam. Harriman had sent for their
wives to come down to the front and witness the display. I was
an orderly at headquarters of the First Brigade, First Division,
Ninth Army Corps, and was detailed to accompany the ladies, who
had an ambulance placed at their disposal. I was mounted, and
coming alongside the vehicle began to instruct the driver where
to go to get the best view of the parade. The fellow, who was
quite under the influence of liquor, identified himself as Mallen,
and sought to renew acquaintance with me.</p>

<p>It went against the grain to go back on an old messmate,
but the situation demanded prompt action. "Bill" was ordered
to attend closely to his driving or he would get into the guardhouse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
with the displeasure of the division commander hanging
over him, which would not be a pleasant experience. He knew
enough about usages at the front, at that time, to understand
this, and finished his drive in moody silence. After the review
was over he went back to the corral with his team, and I to headquarters.
I never saw or heard of him again, the stirring incidents
of the latter days of March, 1865, eclipsing everything else. I
presume he was following the army, nominally as a mule driver,
while he "skinned" the boys at poker as a matter of business.
The whiskey had him down for the time being, however, otherwise
I would have been glad to talk over former times on the
river.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_19"></a>Chapter XIX<br />
<i>Steamboat Racing</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It is popularly supposed that there was a great deal of racing
on Western rivers in the olden time&mdash;in fact, that it was the
main business of steamboat captains and owners, and that the more
prosaic object, that of earning dividends, was secondary. There
is a deal of error in such a supposition. At the risk of detracting
somewhat from the picturesqueness of life on the upper
Mississippi as it is sometimes delineated, it must in truth be said
that little real racing was indulged in, as compared with the
lower river, or even with the preconceived notion of what transpired
on the upper reaches. While there were many so-called
steamboat races, these were, for the most part, desultory and
unpremeditated. On the upper river, there never was such a
race as that between the "Robert E. Lee" and the "Natchez",
where both boats were stripped and tuned for the trial, and where
neither passengers nor freight were taken on board to hinder or
encumber in the long twelve hundred miles between New Orleans
and St. Louis, which constituted the running track.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that whenever two boats happened to
come together, going in the same direction, there was always a
spurt that developed the best speed of both boats, with the result
that the speediest boat quickly passed her slower rival, and out-footed
her so rapidly as soon to leave her out of sight behind some
point, not to be seen again, unless a long delay at some landing
or woodyard enabled her to catch up. These little spurts were
in no sense races, such as the historic runs on the lower waters.
They were in most cases a business venture, rather than a sporting
event, as the first boat at a landing usually secured the passengers
and freight in waiting. Another boat, following so soon after,
would find nothing to add to the profits of the voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Racing, as racing, was an expensive if not a risky business.
Unless the boats were owned by their commanders, and thus
absolutely under their control, there was little chance that permission
would be obtained for racing on such a magnificent and spectacular
scale as that usually depicted in fiction.</p>

<p>The one contest that has been cited by every writer on upper
river topics, that has ever come under my observation, was the
one between the "Grey Eagle" (Captain D. Smith Harris), and
the "Itasca" (Captain David Whitten); and that was not a race
at all. It is manifestly unfair to so denominate it, when one of
the captains did not know that he was supposed to be racing with
another boat until he saw the other steamer round a point just
behind him. Recognizing his rival as following him far ahead
of her regular time, he realized that she was doing something out
of the ordinary. He came to the conclusion that Captain Harris
was attempting to beat him into St. Paul, in order to be the first
to deliver certain important news of which he also was the bearer.
When this revelation was made, both boats were within a few
miles of their destination, St. Paul.</p>

<p>Here are the details. In 1856, the first telegraphic message
was flashed under the sea by the Atlantic cable&mdash;a greeting from
Queen Victoria to President Buchanan. Captain D. Smith
Harris had, the year before, brought out the "Grey Eagle", which
had been built at Cincinnati at a cost of $60,000. He had built
this boat with his own money, or at least a controlling interest
was in his name. He had intended her to be the fastest boat on
the upper river, and she was easily that. As her captain and
practically her owner, he was at liberty to gratify any whim that
might come into his head. In this case it occurred to him that
he would like to deliver in St. Paul the Queen's message to the
President ahead of any one else.</p>

<p>There was at that time no telegraph line into St. Paul.
Lines ran to Dunleith, where the "Grey Eagle" was taking in
cargo for St. Paul, and also to Prairie du Chien, where the
"Itasca" was loading. Both boats were to leave at six o'clock in
the evening. Captain Harris had sixty-one miles farther to run
than had Captain Whitten. But Harris knew that he was racing,
and Whitten did not, which made all the difference in the world.</p>

<p>Whitten soldiered along at his usual gait, stopping at every
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
landing, putting off all cargo at each place, and taking on all that
offered, and probably delayed to pass the compliments of the day
with agents and other friends, as well as discuss the great message
that he was bearing. The "Grey Eagle", on the contrary, stopped
at only a few of the principal landings, and took on no freight
after leaving Dunleith. She did not even put off freight that she
was carrying, but took it through to St. Paul and delivered it on
her return trip. She carried the mail, but in delivering it a man
stood on the end of one of the long stages run out from the bow,
from which he threw the sacks ashore, the boat in the meantime
running along parallel with the levee, and not stopping completely
at any landing. Running far ahead of her time, there were no
mail sacks ready for her, and there was no reason for stopping.
The "Grey Eagle" had the best of soft coal, reinforced by sundry
barrels of pitch, from which the fires were fed whenever they
showed any signs of failing. With all these points in her favor,
in addition to the prime fact that she was by far the swiftest
steamboat that ever turned a wheel on the upper river, it was
possible for her to overtake the slower and totally unconcerned
"Itasca", when only a few miles from St. Paul.</p>

<p>The race proper began when Whitten sighted the "Gray
Eagle" and realized that Harris was trying to beat him into St.
Paul in order to be the first to deliver the Queen's message. Then
the "Itasca" did all that was in her to do, and was beaten by
less than a length, Harris throwing the message ashore from the
roof, attached to a piece of coal, and thus winning the race by a
handbreadth.</p>

<p>The time of the "Grey Eagle" from Dunleith, was eighteen
hours; the distance, two hundred and ninety miles; speed per
hour, 16-1/9 miles.</p>

<p>The "Itasca", ran from Prairie du Chien to St. Paul in
eighteen hours; distance, two hundred and twenty-nine miles;
speed, 12-2/3 miles per hour.</p>

<p>The "Itasca" was far from being a slow boat, and had Whitten
known that Harris was "racing" with him, the "Grey Eagle"
would not have come within several hours of catching her.</p>

<p>As a race against time, however, the run of the "Grey Eagle"
was really something remarkable. A sustained speed of over
sixteen miles an hour for a distance of three hundred miles, upstream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
is a wonderful record for an inland steamboat anywhere,
upper river or lower river; and the pride which Captain Harris
had in his beautiful boat was fully justified. A few years later,
she struck the Rock Island Bridge and sank in less than five minutes,
a total loss. It was pitiful to see the old Captain leaving the
wreck, a broken-hearted man, weeping over the loss of his darling,
and returning to his Galena home, never again to command a
steamboat. He had, during his eventful life on the upper river,
built, owned, or commanded scores of steamboats; and this was
the end.</p>

<p>The "Northerner", of the St. Louis Line, was a fast boat,
and an active contestant for the "broom". The boat that could,
and did run away from, or pass under way, all other boats, signalized
her championship by carrying a big broom on her pilot house.
When a better boat passed her under way, the ethics of the river
demanded that she pull the broom down and retire into seclusion
until she in turn should pass the champion and thus regain her
title. The struggle on the upper river lay between the "Northerner"
and the "Key City". The "Grey Eagle" was in a class
by herself, and none other disputed her claims, while actively
disputing those of all others of the Minnesota Packet Company,
of which the "Key City" was the champion and defender.</p>

<p>The two rivals got together at Hudson, twenty miles up
Lake St. Croix&mdash;whether by accident or agreement it is impossible
to say, but probably by agreement. They had twenty miles
of deep water, two miles wide, with only four close places to run.
It was a fair field for a race, and they ran a fair and a fine one.
For miles they were side by side. Sometimes a spurt would put
one a little ahead; and again the other would get a trifle the most
steam and the deepest water, and so creep ahead a little. When
they came into Prescott, at the foot of the lake, the "Key City"
was a clear length ahead, her engineers having saved a barrel or
two of resin for the home stretch. With this lead she had the
right of way to turn the point and head up the river. Ned West
was at the wheel, with an assistant to "pull her down" for him,
and he made a beautiful turn with his long and narrow craft;
while the "Northerner" had to slow down and wait a minute or
two before making the turn. In the meantime the "Key City's"
whistles were blowing, her bell ringing, and her passengers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
crew cheering, while a man climbed to the roof of the pilot house
and lashed the broom to the finial at the top, the crown of laurels
for the victor.</p>

<p>The lower river stern-wheel steamer "Messenger" was also
a very fast boat. On one occasion she came very near wresting
the broom from the "Key City", in a race through Lake Pepin,
where also there was plenty of water and sea room. The "Key
City" had a barge in tow and thus was handicapped. The "Messenger"
seemed, therefore, likely to win the race, as she had passed
the former under way. Within four miles of the head of the
lake, Captain Worden of the "Key City" ordered the barge cast
adrift, having placed a few men on board of it, with an anchor
and cable to use in case of necessity. Thus freed from the encumbrance,
he put on steam and passed his rival before reaching
Wacouta, in spite of the most strenuous efforts on the part of the
latter to retain her lead. Running far enough ahead of the
"Messenger" to render the maneuver safe, Worden crossed her
bow, and circling around her ran back and picked up his barge.</p>

<p>In this race, it was said by passengers who were on board
the two boats, that the flames actually blazed from the tops of the
tall chimneys on both craft; and on both, men were stationed on
the roof playing streams of water from lines of hose on the chimney
breechings, to prevent the decks from igniting. Under such
conditions it is easy to see how a boat might catch fire and burn.
And yet the passengers liked it. Had they been the owners of
casks of hams, as legend relates of a passenger on a lower river
boat under like circumstances, there is no doubt they would have
made an oblation of them to the gods of heat and steam, rather
than have the other boat win.</p>

<p>The earliest recorded race run on the upper river was that
between the "Nominee", owned and commanded by Captain Orren
Smith, and the "West Newton" (Captain Daniel Smith Harris),
in 1852. In this event but one boat actually ran, for Harris had
no confidence in the ability of his boat to win, and not possessing
the temper that would brook defeat, he declined to start. The
"Nominee" completed the run from Galena to St. Paul and return,
a distance of seven hundred miles, making all landings and handling
all freight and passengers, in fifty-five hours and forty-nine
minutes, an average rate of speed of 12-1/2 miles an hour, half of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
against and half with the current. This was good running, for
the boats of that time. As there was no other boat to compete
for the honor, the "Nominee" carried the broom until she sank
at Britt's Landing, below La Crosse, in 1854.</p>

<p>Bunnell, in his very interesting <i>History of Winona</i>, says:</p>

<p class="blockquote2">"Captain Orren Smith was a very devout man; and while he might
indulge in racing, for the honor of his boat, he believed in keeping the
Sabbath; and as long as he owned the boats which he commanded he
would not run a minute after twelve o'clock Saturday night, but would
tie his boat to the bank, wherever it might be, and remain at rest until
the night following at twelve o'clock, when he would resume the onward
course of his trip. If a landing could be made near a village or settlement
where religious services could be held, the people were invited on
board on Sunday, and if no minister of the gospel was at hand, the zealous
Captain would lead in such service as suited his ideas of duty. But the
Captain's reverence and caution did not save his boat, and she sank below
La Crosse in the autumn of 1854."</p>

<p>Two of the boats on which I served, the "Kate Cassell" and
the "Fanny Harris", while not of the slow class, yet were not
ranked among the fast ones; consequently we had many opportunities
to pass opposition boats under way, and to run away from
boats that attempted to so humiliate us.</p>

<p>There was a great difference in boats. Some were built for
towing, and these were fitted with engines powerful enough, if
driven to their full capacity, to run the boat under, when the
boat had no barges in tow. Other boats had not enough power
to pull a shad off a gridiron. It was the power that cost money.
A boat intended solely for freighting, and which consequently
could take all the time there was, in which to make the trip, did
not require the boilers and engines of a passenger packet in which
speed was a prime factor in gaining patronage.</p>

<p>There is great satisfaction in knowing that the boat you are
steering is just a little faster than the one ahead or behind you.
There is still more satisfaction in feeling, if you honestly can,
that you are just a little faster as a pilot than the man who is
running the other boat. The two combined guarantee, absolutely,
a proper ending to any trial of speed in which you may be engaged.
Either one of them alone may decide the race, as a fast
pilot is able to take his boat over a long course at a better rate
of speed than a man not so well up in his business. If both men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
are equally qualified, then it is certain that the speediest boat will
win.</p>

<p>What conditions determine the speed of two boats, all observable
terms being equal? Nobody knows. The "Key City" and
the "Itasca" were built for twins. Their lines, length, breadth,
and depth of hold were the same; they had the same number and
size boilers, and the parts of their engines were interchangeable;
yet the "Key City" was from one to three miles an hour the
faster boat, with the same pilots at the wheel. It was a fruitful
topic for discussion on the river; but experts never reached a more
enlightening conclusion than, "Well, I don't know". They
didn't.</p>

<p>The boats of the old Minnesota Packet Company averaged
better than those of a later era. In the run from Prairie du
Chien to St. Paul, as noted above, the "Itasca" averaged twelve
miles an hour, upstream, handling all her freight and passengers.
The schedule for the Diamond Jo Line boats, in 1904, allowed
eight miles an hour upstream, and eleven downstream, handling
freight and passengers.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_20"></a>Chapter XX<br />
<i>Music and Art</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century, many an artist
whose canvases found no market in the older cities, found ready
bidders for his brush, to decorate the thirty-foot paddle-boxes of
the big side-wheelers with figures of heroic size; or, with finer
touch, to embellish the cabins of Western steamboats with oil
paintings in every degree of merit and demerit.</p>

<p>The boat carrying my father and his family from Rock
Island to Prescott, upon my first appearance on the Father of
Waters, was the "Minnesota Belle". Her paddle-boxes were
decorated with pictures the same on each side, representing a
beautiful girl, modestly and becomingly clothed, and carrying in
her arms a bundle of wheat ten or twelve feet long, which she
apparently had just reaped from some Minnesota field. In her
right hand she carried the reaping-hook with which it was cut.</p>

<p>All the "Eagles" were adorned with greater than life-size
portraits of that noble bird. Apparently all were drawn from
the same model, whether the boat be a Grey-, Black-, Golden-,
War-, or Spread-Eagle.</p>

<p>The "Northern Belle", also had a very good looking young
woman upon her paddle-boxes. Evidently she exhibited herself
out of pure self-satisfaction, for she had no sheaf of wheat, or any
other evidence of occupation. She was pretty, and she knew it.</p>

<p>The "General Brooke" showed the face and bust, in full
regimentals, of the doughty old Virginian for whom it was named.</p>

<p>Later, the "Phil Sheridan" boasted an heroic figure of Little
Phil, riding in a hurry from Winchester to the front, the hoofs
of his charger beating time to the double bass of the guns at
Cedar Creek, twenty miles away.</p>

<p>The "Minnesota" reproduced the coat-of-arms of the state
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
whose name she bore&mdash;the ploughman, the Indian, and the
motto "L'étoile du Nord". But the majority of the side-wheel
boats boasted only a sunburst on the paddle-boxes, outside of
which, on the perimeter of the wheel-house circle, was the legend
showing to what line or company the boat belonged. The sunburst
afforded opportunity for the artist to spread on colors, and
usually the effect was pleasing and harmonious.</p>

<p>It was the inside work wherein the artists in oil showed
their skill. Certainly there were many panels that showed the
true artistic touch. The "Northern Light", I remember, had
in her forward cabin representations of Dayton Bluff, St. Anthony
Falls, Lover's Leap, or Maiden Rock, drawn from nature,
for which the artist was said to have been paid a thousand dollars.
They were in truth fine paintings, being so adjudged by people
who claimed to be competent critics. On the other hand there
were hundreds of panels&mdash;thousands, perhaps, in the myriad of
boats that first and last plied on the river&mdash;that were the veriest
daubs. These were the handiwork of the house painters who
thought they had a talent for higher things, and who had been
given free hand in the cabin to put their ambitions on record.</p>

<p>There was one case, however, which appealed to the humorous
side of every one who was fortunate enough to see it. It was
not intended that it should strike just this note. The artist who
put it on the broad panel over the office window of the little
stern-wheel "dinkey" from the Wabash, intended to convey a
solemn note of warning to all who might look upon it to flee
temptation. As the painting very nearly faced the bar, it required
no very great stretch of imagination to read into the picture
the warning to beware of the tempter, strong drink, particularly
the brand served out on a Hoosier packet hailing from the Wabash.</p>

<p>In the centre was a vividly-green apple tree, bearing big red
fruit. Our beloved Mother Eve, attired in a white cotton skirt
that extended from waist to knee, was delicately holding a red
scarf over her left shoulder and bosom. Confronting her was a
wofully weak-minded Adam, dressed in the conventional habit
of a wealthy first century Hebrew. The Satanic snake, wearing
a knowing grin on his face, balanced himself on the tip of
his tail.</p>

<p>Thirty years or more after the little boat from the Wabash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
introduced this artistic gem to travellers on the upper river, I saw
a copper-plate engraving two centuries old, from which the
Hoosier artist had painted his panel. It was all there, except
the colors&mdash;the tree, the apples, Eve in her scarf and skirt,
Adam as a respectable Hebrew gentleman, and Satan balanced
on the turn of his tail and leering with a devilish grin at the
young woman who wanted to know it all, and at the lily-livered
Adam who then and there surrendered his captaincy and has been
running as mate ever since.</p>

<p>In the flush times on the river all sorts of inducements were
offered passengers to board the several boats for the up-river
voyage. First of all, perhaps, the speed of the boat was dwelt
upon. It was always past my comprehension why any one who
paid one fare for the trip, including board and lodging as long
as he should be on the boat, and who had three good, if not
"elegant", meals served each day without extra charge, should
have been in such a hurry to get past the most beautiful scenery
to be found anywhere under the sun. I would like nothing better
than to take passage on the veriest plug that ever made three miles
an hour, and having full passage paid, dawdle along for a week,
and thus be enabled to enjoy in a leisurely manner, all the beauties
of river, bluff, and island.</p>

<p>After speed came elegance&mdash;"fast and elegant steamer"&mdash;was
a favorite phrase in the advertisement. An opportunity to
study Eve and her apple, instead of the wealth of beauty which the
Almighty has strewn broadcast over the Mississippi Valley, was an
inducement carrying weight with some. It was a matter of taste.</p>

<p>After elegance came music, and this spoke for itself. The
styles affected by river steamers ranged from a calliope on the roof
to a stringed orchestra in the cabin. My recollection is, that most
of us thought the name "calliope" was derived from some mechanical
appliance in connection with music, with which we were as
yet unfamiliar, the fame of Jupiter's daughter not yet having
extended to the headwaters of the Mississippi. The question as
to what relation this barbaric collection of steam whistles bears
to the epic muse, that it should have appropriated her name, is
still an open question. The "Excelsior", Captain Ward, was
the first to introduce the "steam piano" to a long-suffering passenger
list. Plenty of people took passage on the "Excelsior" in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
order to hear the calliope perform; many of them, long before
they reached St. Paul, wished they had not come aboard, particularly
if they were light sleepers. The river men did not mind
it much, as they were used to noises of all kinds, and when they
"turned in" made a business of sleeping. It was different with
most passengers, and a steam piano solo at three o'clock in the
morning was a little too much music for the money. After its
introduction on the "Excelsior", several other boats armed themselves
with this persuader of custom; but as none of them ever
caught the same passenger the second time, the machine went out
of fashion. Other boats tried brass bands; but while these attracted
some custom they were expensive, and came to be dropped
as unprofitable.</p>

<p>The cabin orchestra was the cheapest and most enduring, as
well as the most popular drawing card. A band of six or eight
colored men who could play the violin, banjo, and guitar, and in
addition sing well, was always a good investment. These men
were paid to do the work of waiters, barbers, and baggagemen, and
in addition were given the privilege of passing the hat occasionally,
and keeping all they caught. They made good wages by this
combination, and it also pleased the passengers, who had no suspicion
that the entire orchestra was hired with the understanding
that they were to play as ordered by the captain or chief clerk, and
that it was a strictly business engagement. They also played for
dances in the cabin, and at landings sat on the guards and played
to attract custom. It soon became advertised abroad which boats
carried the best orchestras, and such lost nothing in the way of
patronage.</p>

<p>Some of the older generation yet living, may have heard Ned
Kendall play the cornet. If not, they may have heard of him, for
his fame was at this time world-wide, as the greatest of all
masters on his favorite instrument. Like many another genius,
strong drink mastered him, and instead of holding vast audiences
spell-bound in Eastern theatres, as he had done, he sold his art to
influence custom on an Alton Line boat. It was my good fortune
to have heard him two or three times, and his music appeals to
me yet, through all the years that lie between. The witchery and
the pathos of "Home, Sweet Home", "Annie Laurie", the "White
Squall", and selections from operas of which I had then never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
even heard the names, cast such a spell that the boat on which
he travelled was crowded every trip. Pity 'tis that one so gifted
should fall into a slavery from which there was no redemption.
He died in St. Louis, poor and neglected, a wreck infinitely more
pitiable than that of the finest steamboat ever cast away on the
Great River.</p>

<p>One of the boats on which I served employed a sextet of
negro firemen, whose duty, in addition to firing, was to sing to
attract custom at the landings. This was not only a unique performance,
but it was likewise good music&mdash;that is, good of its
kind. There was nothing classic about it, but it was naturally
artistic. They sang plantation melodies&mdash;real negro melodies;
not the witless and unmusical inanities which under the name of
"coon songs" pass with the present generation for negro minstrelsy.
Of course these darkies were picked for their musical
ability, and were paid extra wages for singing.</p>

<p>The leader, Sam Marshall, received more than the others,
because he was an artist. This term does not do him justice. In
addition to a voice of rare sweetness and power, Sam was a born
<i>improvisatore</i>. It was his part of the entertainment to stand on
the capstan-head, with his chorus gathered about him, as the boat
neared the landing. If at night, the torch fed with fatwood and
resin threw a red glow upon his shining black face, as he lifted up
his strong, melodious voice, and lined out his improvised songs,
which recited the speed and elegance of this particular boat, the
suavity and skill of its captain, the dexterity of its pilots, the manfulness
of its mate, and the loveliness of Chloe, its black chambermaid.
This latter reference always "brought down the house", as
Chloe usually placed herself in a conspicuous place on the guards to
hear the music, and incidentally the flatteries of her coal-black lover.
As each line was sung by the leader the chorus would take up the
refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">De Captain stands on de upper deck;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">(Ah ha-a-a-ah! Oh ho-o-o-o-ho!)"</div>
<div class="verse">You nebber see 'nudder such gentlehem, <i>I</i> 'spec;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">(Ah ha-a-a-ah, Oh ho-o-o-ho.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and then would follow, as an interlude, the refrain of some old
plantation melody in the same key and meter, the six darkies singing
their parts in perfect time and accord, and with a melody that
cannot be bettered in all the world of music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">De pilot he twisses he big roun' wheel;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">(Ah ha-a-a-ah! Oh ho-o-o-o-ho.)</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He sings, and he whissels, and he dance Virginia reel,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">(Ah ha-a-a-ah, Oh ho-o-o-ho),&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>an undoubted reference to Tom Cushing, who, before his promotion
to the pilot house was said to have been a tenor in grand
opera in New York. He was a beautiful singer at any rate; could
whistle like a New York newsboy, and dance like a coryphée.
The "Old Man" would have been willing to take his oath that
Cushing could and did do all three at the same time, in the most
untimely hours of the morning watch, at the same time steering
his steamboat in the most approved fashion.</p>

<p>The next stanza was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"'Gineer in the engin' room listenn' fo' de bell;</div>
<div class="verse">He boun' to beat dat oder boat or bus' 'em up to&mdash;<i>heb'n</i>,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>was accepted as a distinct reference to Billy Hamilton, as the
manner of stating his intention to win out in a race was peculiar
to the junior engineer, and the proposition was accepted without
debate.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"De Debbel he come in the middle of de night;</div>
<div class="verse">Sam, dere, he scairt so he tuhn <i>mos'</i> white&mdash;Jes like
dat white man out dere on de lebbee",</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>pointing at some one whom he deemed it safe to poke fun at, and
of course raising a laugh at the expense of the individual so
honored.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Des <i>look</i> at dem white fokses standin' on de sho';</div>
<div class="verse">Dey la-a-aff, and dey la-a-aff, till dey cain't laff no mo'&mdash;ha-ha-ha-ha-ha",</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and Sam would throw back his head and laugh a regular contagion
into the whole crowd&mdash;on the boat and "on de sho", opening
a mouth which one of the darkies asserted was "de biggest mouf
dis nigger ebber saw on any human bein' 'cept a aligator"; or, as
the mate expressed it: "It was like the opening of navigation."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Dish yer nigger he fire at the middle do';</div>
<div class="verse">Shake 'em up libely for to make de boat go",</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>was a somewhat ornate description of Mr. Marshall's own duties
on board the boat. As a matter of fact he did very little firing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
personally, although when a race was on he could shovel coal or
pitch four-foot wood into the middle door with the best of them,
at the same time, singing at the top of his voice. Upon ordinary
occasions he let the other darkies pitch the cord wood while he
exercised a general supervision over them, as became an acknowledged
leader.</p>

<p>To hear these darkies sing the real slave music, which was
older than the singers, older than the plantation, as old as Africa
itself, wherein the ancestors of some of them at least, might have
been kings and princes as well as freemen, was better than the
fo'c'sle comedies enacted for the amusement of the passengers.
These minor chords carried a strain of heartbreak, as in the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"De night is dark, de day is long</div>
<div class="verse">And we are far fum home,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Weep, my brudders, weep!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the closing lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"De night is past, de long day done,</div>
<div class="verse">An' we are going home,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Shout, my brudders, shout!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>were a prophecy of that day of freedom and rest, after centuries
of toil and bondage, the dawn of which was even then discernible
to those who, like Abraham Lincoln, were wise to read in the
political heavens the signs of its coming.</p>

<i>Steamboat Bonanzas</i></h2>
</div>

<p>How it was possible to derive any profit from an investment
of from $20,000 to $40,000, the principal of which had an average
tenure of life of but five years, has puzzled a great many conservative
business men from "down east", where "plants" lasted a
lifetime, and the profits from which may have been sure, but were
certain to be small. A man educated in such an atmosphere would
hesitate long, before investing $25,000 in a steamboat that was
foreordained to the scrap pile at the end of five summers; or where
one out of every two was as certainly predestined to go up in smoke
or down into the mud of the river bottom at the end of four years&mdash;these
periods representing the ordinary life of a Mississippi River
steamboat.</p>

<p>From 1849 to 1862 the shipyards of the Ohio, where nine out
of ten Western boats were built, could not keep up with the orders.
Every available shipwright was employed, and on some boats gangs
worked at night by the light of torches at double wages, so great
was the demand. Every iron foundry was likewise driven to the
limit to turn out engines, boilers, and other machinery with which
to give life to the hulls that were growing as if by magic in every
shipyard.</p>

<p>If there had not been profit in the business, the captains and
other river men who gave orders for these craft would not have
given them. By far the greater number of boats were built for
individual owners&mdash;practical river men who navigated the boats,
and who knew just what they were about. Many of the orders
were given to replace vessels that had been snagged or burned
within the past twenty-four hours&mdash;for time was money, and a
man could not afford to be without a steamboat many weeks, when
twenty weeks or less represented a new boat in net earnings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
These men knew from actual experience that if they could keep
their craft afloat for two years they could build a new boat from
the profits made with her, even if she sank or burned at the end
of that time. If she kept afloat for four years, they could buy or
build two or three new ones from the profits, even without the aid
of insurance. As a matter of fact the boats carrying insurance in
those days were the exceptions. It came high, and owners preferred
to take their own chances rather than indulge to any great
extent in that luxury. How such profits were earned and such
results obtained, it will be the object of this chapter to disclose.</p>

<p>In those days every boat made money. A big and fast one
made a great deal; those small and slow made little as compared
with their larger rivals, but plenty as compared with their own
cost. Perhaps most vessel owners began on a small scale. A
little boat might cost $5,000. She would run on some tributary
of the Great River, and in the absence of any railroads might
control all the traffic she was capable of handling, and at her own
rates. In the course of two or three years her owner was able
to build a bigger and a better boat. By combining with some
other river man, the two might build one costing $25,000, and
carrying from a hundred and fifty to two hundred tons of freight,
and passengers in proportion. With such an equipment there
was a fortune in sight at any time between 1849 and 1862, provided
always that the boat was not snagged or burned on her first
trip.</p>

<p>The doctrine (or science) of averages, is peculiar. In order
to get an average of four years for a steamboat's life, it is necessary
to keep some of them afloat for nine or ten; while on the
other hand you are certain to "kill" a lot of them within a year
after they touch water. When the latter happens, the investment
is lost and the owner is probably ruined.</p>

<p>For purposes of illustration we will take as a sample one
from the best class of money-makers on the upper river, in the
flush times of 1857. Minnesota was organized as a territory in
1849, and admitted as a state in 1858. From 1852 to 1857 there
were not boats enough to carry the people who were flocking into
this newly-opened farmers' and lumbermen's paradise. There
were over a hundred and twenty-five different steamboats registered
at St. Paul in the latter year. The boats carrying good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
cargoes all through the season were the money-makers. Some of
the larger ones were unable to get over the sand-bars after the
midsummer droughts began. The stern-wheel boat of two hundred
to three hundred tons was the one that could handle a good
cargo on little water, and represented the highest type of profit-earning
craft.</p>

<p>Such a boat would be about 200 feet long, 30 feet beam,
and five feet depth of hold. She would have three large iron
boilers (steel not having entered largely into boiler construction
at that time), and fairly large engines, giving her good speed
without an excessive expenditure for fuel. She would cost from
$25,000 to $30,000, and accommodate two hundred cabin passengers
comfortably, with a hundred second-class people on deck.</p>

<p>With such a boat furnished and ready for business, it is the
duty of the captain to go out and hire his crew, and fit her
out for a month's work. Such an investment in 1857, on the
upper river, would approximate the following figures:</p>

<p>With this wage-list and expense-account before them, the
captain and his chief clerk, who may also be a part owner in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the boat, are face to face with the problem of meeting such expenses
from passenger and cargo lists, and at the same time
providing a sinking fund with which to build another craft
within four years. To the uninitiated this would seem a somewhat
appalling problem; with these old hands, the question would
no doubt resolve itself down to the number of round trips that
they would have to make to pay for their boat. The question of
years never enters their heads.</p>

<p>In 1857 there were three principal points of departure on
the upper river, above St. Louis. At that time St. Louis itself
was the great wholesale centre, but it was not so important as an
initial point for passengers for the upper Mississippi. The flood
of immigration from St. Louis was for many reasons up the
Missouri: furs and gold could be found in the mountains; there
was a possible slave state in the farming regions below the mountains.
The people who settled Minnesota and northern Wisconsin
came from the East, and reached the river at three points&mdash;Rock
Island, Dunleith (or Galena), and Prairie du Chien.
Taking the point with which I am most familiar, we will start the
new boat from Galena.</p>

<p>At that time Galena was, next to St. Louis, the principal
wholesale <i>entrepôt</i> in the West. It was a poor trip for the boat
which I have taken as a model, when she did not get a hundred
tons of freight at Galena from the wholesale houses there. The
balance was found at Dunleith, the terminus of what is now the
Illinois Central Railway (then the Galena &amp; Western Union);
at Dubuque, which was also a big wholesale town; and at Prairie
du Chien, the terminus of the Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railway.</p>

<p>The freight rates on the river ran from 25 cents per hundred
for short distances, to $1.50 per hundred from Galena to Stillwater,
or St. Paul. No package was taken at less than 25
cents, however small it was, or how short the distance. In order
not to overstate, we will take fifty cents per hundred as the average,
and three hundred tons of cargo as the capacity of the two
hundred-ton boat.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This is relatively the capacity of a vessel of
that tonnage after deducting for passengers and fuel, and the
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
space occupied by deck passengers. This latter item did not
seriously count, for the freight was usually taken first and the
deck passengers were then piled on top of it. Their comfort or
convenience was never taken into consideration.</p>

<p>
The boat can carry two hundred cabin passengers, and a
hundred on deck. We will assume that there is another boat
competing for this trip, and we do not fill up to the capacity.
The clerk studies the rate sheets in vogue in 1857, and finds

<p>In 1904, the cabin passage on the Diamond Jo Line boats
from Dunleith to St. Paul, was $8.00; from Prairie du Chien,
$6.75; from La Crosse, $4.75. This is in competition with six
railroads practically paralleling the river. In 1857 there was no
railroad competition, and practically none from steamboats. Every
boat attained a full passenger list, and was at liberty to charge
whatever the conscience of the captain dictated&mdash;assuming a
conscience. I have known a boat to fill up at Dunleith at the
rate of $16.00 to St. Paul, and contract that all the men should
sleep on the cabin floor, leaving staterooms for the women. And
the passengers were glad enough to accept such conditions, for a
detention of two days at Dunleith would cost a far greater sum
than the overcharge exacted by the steamboat officers.</p>

<p>In the foregoing table I have included La Crosse, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
however, was not an active factor in river rates until 1859. Before
then, hundreds of passengers were landed there from Rock
Island, Dunleith, and Prairie du Chien; but as the railroad had
not yet reached the river at that point, there were but few passengers
from La Crosse for landings farther up the river. When
our boat leaves Prairie du Chien, then, the following business is
in sight:</p>

<p>Downstream rates are somewhat less than the upstream,
because, for one reason, it costs less to get a boat downstream.
There is a four-mile current pushing the boat along, in addition
to the applied power. Going upstream the boat had had this
current to overcome before she gained an inch. A four-mile
current is one-third of an average steamboat's progress. Again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the passengers do not get a chance to eat as much, and very often
they were not served as well, on the down trip. Then, there
were fewer people who wished to go down river, with the result
that there were many boats bidding for the patronage of those
who did make the trip. All these elements, with possibly others,
entered into the cutting of the rates by about one-third on the
down trip.</p>

<p>The only item besides passengers to be depended upon on the
return trip, was wheat. There may have been some potatoes or
barley, or, if fortune favored, some tons of furs and buffalo robes
from the "Red River train", or some flour from the one mill at St.
Anthony (now Minneapolis), or perhaps woodenware from the
same point. There was always a more or less assorted cargo, but
the mainstay was wheat. We will assume, in order to simplify
this illustration, that there was nothing but wheat in sight at the
time. There was no question about getting it. Every boat got
all the wheat it could carry, and the shippers begged, almost on
bended knees, for a chance to ship five hundred sacks, or a hundred,
or fifty&mdash;any amount would be considered a great favor.
Wheat was shipped at that time in two-bushel sacks, each weighing
a hundred and twenty pounds. Three hundred tons, dead weight,
is a pretty good cargo for a two-hundred ton boat. Wheat is dead
weight, and a boat goes down into the water fast, when that is the
sole cargo. We get five thousand sacks, all of which is unloaded
at Prairie du Chien. The down trip foots up somewhat like this:</p>

<p>A stern-wheel, light-draught boat such as we have taken
for this illustration, was quite certain to get five months' service&mdash;between
the middle of April and the middle of October. In
order not to put too great tension upon the credulity of modern
readers, we will assume that she gets only five months of navigation.
At the close of the season the captain and his clerk figure
up the receipts and expenses, and strike a balance like this:</p>

<p>This is enough to buy a new boat, and have something over
for pin money. No one knows better than the writer the elusiveness,
not to say the mendacity, of figures. He has often figured
out greater profits than this in the nebulous schemes which have
from time to time seduced him from the straight and narrow
path of six per cent investment&mdash;and had them come out the
other way. In steamboating in the fifties, this occurred very
often. The most careful captain, employing the highest-priced
pilots and engineers, would often lose his boat the first season;
a snag or a lighted match, or a little too much steam, dissipating
the best-laid plans in a few minutes of time. But the figures
given above are conservative&mdash;made so purposely. The truth
lies at the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>If the books of some of the boats of the old Minnesota
Packet Company could be resurrected, they would show earnings
and profits far greater than I have ventured to claim in my illustration.
The "Fanny Harris", for instance, was a boat of 279
tons. Her wage-list and expense-account have been taken as
a basis of the illustration above given, partly from recollection, and
partly from figures which I made when I was second clerk, and
which I have had before me in writing this chapter. We used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
to tow one barge all the time&mdash;most of the time two barges, and
both boat and barges loaded to the water line, both ways, nearly
every trip.</p>

<p>Of course we sometimes missed it. We landed ten thousand
sacks of wheat at Prairie du Chien on one trip. Instead of a hundred
and fifty cabin passengers, she often carried three hundred,
"sleeping them" on the cabin floor three deep&mdash;at stateroom rates;
and under such conditions the fortunate winners of such a chance to
get into the promised land have risen up and called the whole outfit
blessed, when in fact it was the other thing. I have heard of other
boats claiming that they had to tow an extra barge to carry the
money which they took in on the trip. I have always thought
that these men were slightly overstating the case&mdash;but maybe not.</p>

<p>An item in one of the St. Paul papers of the time, states that
the "Excelsior" arrived from St. Louis November 20, 1852, with
two hundred and fifty cabin passengers, one hundred and fifty
deck passengers, and three hundred tons of freight. For which
freight she received "one dollar per hundred for any distance";
and the net profits of the up trip on freight alone were over
$8,000. For two hundred and fifty cabin passengers she would
receive $16 each, or $4,000; for the deck passengers, $8 each,
or $1,200. These sums added to the $8,000 received for freight,
would aggregate $13,200. The "Excelsior" cost not to exceed
$20,000&mdash;probably not over $16,000. Two trips like this would
build a better boat. As this was the last trip of the season, she
probably did not get such another. Under that freight rate&mdash;"one
dollar per hundred for any distance"&mdash;a shipment of a
hundred pounds from Prescott to Point Douglass, one mile, would
cost the shipper a dollar. There were possibilities in such conditions.</p>

<p>Another item, also from a St. Paul paper, states that the
"Lady Franklin" arrived May 8, 1855, from Galena, with five
hundred passengers. She would accommodate a hundred and fifty
cabin people, ordinarily. Figure this trip down to the probabilities,
and the net result would be about as follows:</p>

<table id="TEXTF" summary="franklin">

<p>The "Lady Franklin" cost about $20,000. Two months'
work at this rate would buy a new and better boat. If I remember
aright, the "Lady Franklin" was sunk in 1856 or 1857,
but not until she had earned money enough to buy two new boats,
each costing twice as much as she did. At the time she carried
five hundred passengers she undoubtedly carried a full cargo of
freight, worth at least two thousand dollars more to the boat.</p>

<p>An item in a St. Louis paper of that date, announces the
departure of the side-wheel steamer "Tishomingo" (Jenks, master),
for St. Paul on April 14, 1857, with 465 cabin passengers,
93 deck passengers and 400 tons of assorted freight. This trip
would figure somewhat like this:</p>

<table id="TEXTH" summary="tishomingo">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">465 cabin passengers at an average of $16</td>
  <td class="tdrp">$ 7,440.00</td>

  <td class="tdl">93 deck passengers at an average of $8</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Net earnings for the season</td>
  <td class="tdrp">$14,184.00</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These rates are estimated at a very low figure. The regular
cabin rate at that time, St. Louis to St. Paul, was, for cabin,
$24; deck, $12; freight, $1.50 per hundredweight. It is not
necessary to amplify at all. The "Tishomingo" had been bought
in the spring of 1857, within a month, for $25,000. She paid
one-half her purchase price on her first trip that season.</p>

<p>I would not have it understood that all boats made these
phenomenal earnings; but many boats did, and all those of the
Minnesota Packet Company were in this favored class. There
were several conditions precedent, which made these results possible
with the boats of this line. It controlled, absolutely, the
freighting from the Galena and Dubuque jobbing houses; it controlled,
absolutely, the freight business of the Dunleith and Prairie
du Chien railroads, and practically all the passenger business of
the two roads, as steamboat tickets were sold on the train, good
only on the boats of the Minnesota Packet Company. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
conditions insured a full cargo for every boat, and a full passenger
list every trip. Outside boats did not have such a "cinch",
but each had a source of revenue of its own, equally satisfactory.
Even the "wild" boats had no difficulty in getting cargoes, and
every vessel in that busy era had all the business it could handle.</p>

<p>The term "Company" was something of a misnomer. It was
not at first a stock company, in the modern sense of the word.
Each boat was owned by its captain, or a number of persons
acting individually. In organizing the company, instead of capitalizing
it with a certain amount of stock, the controlling parties
simply put in their steamboats and pooled their earnings. Each
boat had an equal chance with all the others for a cargo; and
when the dividends were declared each one shared according to
the earnings of his boat. A big boat could earn more than a
smaller or slower one, and such a boat got a larger percentage
than the latter. The particular advantage, in fact the only advantage,
in pooling lay in securing a monopoly of the railroad
and jobbing business. In order to do this it was necessary to have
boats enough to handle the business at all times, and to have a
general manager who would place the craft so as to give the most
effective service.</p>

<p>One of the beauties of the pooling system was, that if a
captain or owner became dissatisfied and desired to pull out, he
could take his boat and the share of profits due him, and leave
at any time. A few years later the company was reorganized as
a joint stock company. After that, if one wished to get out he
was lucky if he could get clear with the clothes on his back. The
financiers who controlled fifty-one per cent of the stock retained
all the steamboats and all the profits.</p>

<i>Wild-cat Money and Town-sites</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Both of these specimens of natural history were bred, nurtured,
and let loose in countless numbers to prey upon the people
in the early days that witnessed the opening of the Northwestern
territories to settlement. The wild-cat dollars waxed fat upon
the blood and brawn of the settlers who had already arrived;
wild-cat town-sites found ready victims in the thousands of Eastern
people who desired to better their fortunes, and who lent ready
ears to the golden tales of unscrupulous promoters, that told of
wonderful cities in the West, whose only reality was that blazoned
in the prospectuses scattered broadcast through the East.</p>

<p>The younger generation, whose only acquaintance with the
circulating symbols of wealth that we call "money", is confined
to the decades since the close of the War of Secession, can have
no idea of the laxity of banking laws of the fifties, in the Northwestern
states and territories, nor of the instability of the so-called
"money" that comprised nine-tenths of the medium of exchange
then in use in the West. Nowadays, a bank bill stands for
its face value in gold, if it be a National Bank issue. If a state
bank&mdash;and bills of this sort are comparatively few in these days&mdash;they
are also guaranteed, in a measure, by the laws of the state
in which the bank is situated. In the days of which I am writing,
and especially in the unsettled and troublesome times just before
the war (from 1856 to 1862), the money that was handled on
the river in the prosecution of business, except of course the small
proportion of gold that was still in circulation, had little or no
backing, either by federal or state enactments.</p>

<p>A man went into an embryo city, consisting in that day of
two or three thousand town lots, and from fifty to a hundred
inhabitants, with an iron box costing twenty-five dollars. In this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
box he had ten, twenty, or thirty thousand "dollars" in new
bank bills purporting to have been issued from two, three, or four
banks doing business in other equally large, populous, and growing
cities, situated elsewhere in Wisconsin, or preferably in Illinois,
Indiana, or Michigan. How did he become possessed of all this
wealth? Was it the savings of years? The iron box was, perhaps;
perhaps he got trusted for that. The money was not usually
the savings of any time at all; it was simply printed to order.</p>

<p>Five or six persons desirous of benefitting their fellow men
by assisting them in opening their farms and "moving their crops",
would get together in Chicago, Cincinnati, or St. Louis, wherever
there was an establishment capable of engraving and printing bank
bills&mdash;and not very elegant or artistic printing was required, or
desired. These men propose to start as many banks, in as many
"cities" in the West. They have money enough, each of them,
to buy a safe, an iron box into which any carpenter could bore
with an ordinary brace and bit, and enough over to pay for
the printing of twenty thousand dollars' worth of bills in denominations
of one, two, five and ten dollars. The printing finished,
each man would sign his own bills as president, and one of the
others would add the final touch of authenticity by signing a
fictitious name to the same bills as cashier. Then it was "money".</p>

<p>But it would have been overloading the credulity of even
the most gullible denizens of his adopted city to ask them to accept
his own bills as legal tender; so a swap was made all around, and
when the requisite amount of shuffling was completed, each man
had his twenty thousand dollars in bills on four or five banks,
but none of his own issue. There was a double incentive in this
transaction: first, it inspired the utmost confidence in the minds
of the men who were to borrow this money. How could this
banker who had come among them for their good, have acquired
this money by any other than legitimate transactions? If it were
bills on his own bank that he proposed to put into circulation,
there might be some question as to their guaranty; but he could
not get this money by merely going to the printing office and ordering
it, as he might in case of bills on his own institution. It
certainly must be good money. Secondly, by distributing his bills
in as many different localities as possible, the chances of its never
being presented for redemption were greatly multiplied; it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
be burned, or lost overboard, or worn out, in which case he would
be just so much ahead, and no questions asked.</p>

<p>The foregoing may be a somewhat fanciful statement of the
way in which the bankers proceeded, but in essence it is a true
picture. They may not have all met in Chicago, or anywhere
else, to perfect these arrangements, but the arrangements were
all perfected practically as stated: "You put my bills into circulation,
and I will put out yours; and in each case the exchange will
greatly assist each and all of us in hoodwinking our victims into the
belief that it is money, and not merely printed paper which we
are offering them".</p>

<p>Equipped with these goods, and with a charter from the
state in which he proposed to operate&mdash;a charter granted for the
asking, and no questions raised&mdash;the banker transports himself
and his box of money to his chosen field of operations. The newspaper
which has already been located in the new city heralds
the coming of Mr. Rothschild, our new banker, more or less definitely
hinting at the great wealth lying behind the coming financier.
A bank building is rented, a sign hung out, and he begins to
loan his money at five per cent per month on the partially-improved
farms of his neighbors, or the house and lot of his "city" friends.
He is a liberal man, and if it is not convenient for you to pay
the interest as it accrues, he will let it stand&mdash;but he does
not forget to compound it every month. The result is inevitable.
The debt mounts up with a rapidity that paralyzes the borrower,
and in the end a foreclosure adds farm and improvements to the
growing assets of the banker. Within a very few years he is
the owner of eight or ten of the best farms in the county, and
perhaps half a dozen houses and lots in the village, and all with
the investment of less than a hundred dollars invested in printing,
and an iron box, and without the expenditure of an ounce of
energy or a legitimate day's work. And the victims break up
and start anew for the still farther West, to take new farms, to
be engulfed in the maws of other sharks. One may not greatly
pity the men themselves, for men are born to work and suffer; but
the women! God pity them. Worn, tired, broken-hearted, they
must leave that which is dearest to them in all the world, their
homes, and fare forth again into the wilderness, to toil and suffer,
and at last, blessed release, to die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
And the bankers? They were counted honest. If by any chance
one of their bills came to hand and was presented for payment
at the home counter, it was promptly redeemed, sometimes in gold
or silver, but oftener with another bill on some other bank
belonging to the syndicate. I personally knew some of these
bankers. Some of them were freebooters without conscience and
without shame. Under color of law, they robbed the settlers of
their lands and improvements, and defied public opinion. Others
put on a cloak of righteousness; they were leaders in the love-feasts
and pillars in the church; and they also had their neighbors'
lands and improvements. Their descendants are rich and respected
to-day in the communities where their fathers plied their
iniquitous trade; and these rule where their fathers robbed.</p>

<p>As a clerk on the river, I had some experience in handling
the wild-cat money. At Dunleith, before starting on the up-river
trip, we were handed by the secretary of the company, a <i>Thompson's
Bank Note Detector</i>, and with it a list of the bills that we
might accept in payment for freight or passage. We were also
given a list of those that we might not accept at all; and still
another list upon which we might speculate, at values running from
twenty-five to seventy-five per cent of their face denominations.
Thus equipped we started upstream, and the trouble started with
us. At McGregor we put off a lot of freight, and were tendered
money. We consulted our lists and cast into outer darkness that
which had upon it the anathema of Mr. Jones, the secretary. We
accepted all on the list of the elect, and compromised upon enough
more to balance our freight account. The agent at McGregor
had a list of his own which partly coincided with ours but in
general disagreed. In the meantime another boat of our line had
arrived from up river, and we get from her clerk fifteen or twenty
lists of bills which would be taken or rejected at as many landings
above. This helps somewhat, as we see our way clear to get rid
of some of our twenty-five per cent stuff at par in exchange for
cord wood or stores on the upper river, and we sort our stock out
into packages which are reported current at each landing. We also
see an opportunity to swap at Dunleith some bills which are not
current there at all, but which are taken at par at Prescott or Stillwater,
for other bills which they do not want but which will be
taken at the company's office at Dunleith in settlement of our trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
It required a long head to figure it out. Mine was long
enough, but unfortunately it had the same dimensions both ways,
and was not to be depended upon in these finer transactions. Mr.
Hargus labored with the problem, studying lists until he came
nigh to the point of insanity, with the result that when we "cashed
in" on our return it was usually found that we had from five hundred
to a thousand dollars that was not acceptable. This we kept,
and the boat was debited with the amount on the company's books.
On the next trip we would usually be able to work off some of
this stuff. At the end of one season I recollect that we had some
two thousand dollars, face estimate, of this paper on hand, which
the treasurer would not accept, for the banks on which the bills
were drawn had gone out of existence.</p>

<p>The town-site industry was on the same plane of deception
and robbery as the banking frauds, but it found its victims "back
East", instead of close at hand. Being Easterners, who had been
educated to suppose that integrity and honesty were the basis of
all business confidence, and themselves practiced these old-fashioned
virtues, they all too readily accepted the assurances of the land-sharks,
and invested their money without seeing the property
which was so glowingly described in the prospectuses sent out by
the Western promoters. The result was, that they were "taken
in and done for" by the hundreds of town-site sharks who were
operating all along the river, between Dunleith and St. Paul. I
shall refer to but one of which I had personal knowledge, and to
another described to me by Captain Russell Blakeley.</p>

<p>The city of Nininger, as delineated on the large and beautifully-engraved
and printed maps issued by Ingenuous Doemly, was
a well-built metropolis capable of containing ten thousand people.
As delineated, it had a magnificent court house, this city being
the county seat of Dakota County, Minnesota. Four or five
church spires sprang a hundred feet each into the atmosphere.
It had stores and warehouses, crowded with merchandise, and
scores of drays and draymen were working with feverish energy
to keep the levee clear of the freight being landed from half a
dozen well-known steamboats belonging to the Minnesota Packet
Company or the St. Louis &amp; St. Paul Packet Company. An
imposing brick structure with cut stone trimmings, four stories
high, housed the plant of the Nininger <i>Daily Bugle</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
This last-mentioned feature of the prospectus was the only
one that had the remotest semblance of foundation in fact. There
certainly was a <i>Daily Bugle</i>, issued once a week, or once in two
or three weeks, depending upon the energy of the printer and his
"devil", who jointly set the type, and the assiduity of the editors
who furnished them with copy. This paper was printed upon the
first power press that ever threw off a printed sheet in the Territory
of Minnesota. It was a good press, and the paper printed
upon it was a monument to the shrewdness and ingenuity of the
honorable proprietor of the Nininger town-site. The sheet was
filled with a wealth of local advertising&mdash;drygoods, groceries,
hardware, millinery, shoe stores, blacksmith shops&mdash;every class
of business found in a large and prosperous city, was represented
in those columns. But every name and every business was fictitious,
coined in the fertile brain of this chief of all promoters. It
was enough to deceive the very elect&mdash;and it did. When the
Eastern man read that there were six or eight lots, lying just
west of Smith &amp; Jones's drygoods store, on West Prairie Street,
that could be had at a thousand dollars per lot if taken quickly,
and that they were well worth twice that money on account of
the advantageous situation, they were snapped up as a toad snaps
flies on a summer day.</p>

<p>The paper was filled with local reading matter, describing
the rush at the opening of the latest emporium; that Brown had
gone East to purchase his spring stock; that Mrs. Newbody
entertained at her beautiful new residence on Park Avenue, and
gave the names of fifty of her guests. The whole thing was the
plan of a Napoleonic mind, being carried out to the minutest
detail with painstaking care by a staff of able workers, with
the result that the whole prairie for two miles back from the
river was sold out at the rate of ten thousand dollars an acre
or upwards, and that before the proprietor had himself perfected
his legal rights to the land which he was thus retailing.</p>

<p>Henry Lindergreen, the printer who did the mechanical
work on the Nininger paper, was a chum of mine, we having
set type in the same "alley" elsewhere, and that winter I went
up to Nininger to help him out. The four-story brick block
of the wood-cuts shrunk into a little frame building, the sides
of which were made of inch boards set up on end and battened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
on the outside. Inside, it was further reinforced with tarred
paper; and while I was there a pail of water ten feet from a red-hot
stove, froze solid in a night, and the three printers had all
they could do to feed the fire fast enough to keep themselves from
freezing also, with the mercury down to forty degrees below
zero. The editor who, in the absence of the promoter himself,
in the East disposing of lots, was hired to improvise facts
for the columns of this veracious sheet, lived in St. Paul, and sent
his copy down to Hastings, as there was no postoffice at Nininger.
If the editor or the proprietor had been found at Nininger in
the following spring when the dupes began to appear, one or
two of the jack oaks with which the city lots were plentifully
clothed, would have borne a larger fruit than acorns. Even the
printer who set the type, was forced to flee for his life.</p>

<p>One of the boldest-faced swindles I ever heard of, was the
so-called Rolling Stone colony. In the spring of 1852, some
three or four hundred people, chiefly from New York city, came
to seek their purchased lands in Rolling Stone. They brought
with them beautiful maps and bird's-eye views of the place, showing
a large greenhouse, lecture hall, and library. Each colonist
was to have a house lot in town and a farm in the neighboring
country. The colony had been formed by one William Haddock,
and none of the members had the faintest shadow of experience
in farming. Boarding steamers at Galena, they expected to be
put off at the Rolling Stone levee, for the views represented large
houses, a hotel, a big warehouse, and a fine dock. But the steamboat
officers had never heard of such a place. Careful questioning,
however, seemed to locate the site three miles above Wabasha
Prairie, on land then belonging to the Sioux Indians. As they
insisted on landing, they were put off at the log cabin of one
John Johnson, the only white man within ten miles. They made
sod houses for themselves, or dug shelter burrows in the river
banks; sickness came; many died during the summer and autumn;
and when winter set in the place was abandoned. The people
suffered severely, and the story of Rolling Stone makes a sad
chapter in the early history of Minnesota.</p>

<p>While the craze was on, some made fortunes, while thousands
of trusting men and women lost the savings of years. After the
fever of speculation had burned itself out, the actual builders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
of the commonwealth came in and subdued the land. Nininger
and Rolling Stone are still on the map, and that is about all there
is of them&mdash;a name. La Crosse, Winona, St. Paul and Minneapolis
have superseded them, and the population, wealth, and
commerce of these are greater in reality than were the airy figments
of the brain which they have supplanted.</p>

<i>A Pioneer Steamboatman</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The same year and the same month in the year that witnessed
the advent of the first steamboat on the Upper Mississippi,
likewise witnessed the arrival in Galena of one who was destined
to become the best known of all the upper river steamboatmen.
In April, 1823, James Harris<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> accompanied by his son, Daniel
Smith Harris, a lad of fifteen, left Cincinnati on the keel boat
"Colonel Bumford", for the Le Fevre lead mines (now Galena),
where they arrived June 20, 1823, after a laborious voyage down
the Ohio and up the Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
A word in passing, regarding the keel boat. Few of the
men now living know from actual observation what manner of
craft is suggested by the mere mention of the name. None of
this generation have seen it. A canal boat comes as near it in
model and build as any craft now afloat; and yet it was not a
canal boat. In its day and generation it was the clipper of the
Western river to which it was indigenous. Any sort of craft
might go downstream; rafts, arks, broadhorns, and scows were
all reliable downstream sailers, dependent only upon the flow
of the current, which was eternally setting toward the sea. All
of this sort of craft did go down, with every rise in the Ohio, in the
early days of the nineteenth century, from every port and landing
between Pittsburg and Cairo, to New Orleans. They were laden
with adventurers, with pioneers, with settlers, or with produce
of the farms already opened along the Ohio and its tributaries;
corn, wheat, apples, live-stock&mdash;"hoop-poles and punkins", in
the slang of the day&mdash;in fact anything of value to trade for the
merchandise of civilization which found its <i>entrepôt</i> at New
Orleans from Europe or the Indies. The craft carrying this
produce was itself a part of the stock in trade, and when unloaded
was broken up and sold as lumber for the building of the city,
or for export to Cuba or other West Indian ports. The problem
was to get back to the Ohio with the cargo of merchandise bought
with the produce carried as cargo on the down trip. The broad
horns and arks were an impossibility as upstream craft, and thus
it came about in the evolution of things required for specific purposes,
that the keel boat came into being.</p>

<p>This boat was built to go upstream as well as down. It was
a well-modelled craft, sixty to eighty feet long, and fifteen to
eighteen feet wide, sharp at both ends, and often with fine lines&mdash;clipper-built
for passenger traffic. It had usually about four feet
depth of hold. Its cargo box, as it was called, was about four
feet higher, sometimes covered with a light curved deck; sometimes
open, with a "gallows-frame" running the length of the
hold, over which tarpaulins were drawn and fastened to the sides
of the boat for the protection of the freight and passengers in
stormy weather. At either end of the craft was a deck for eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
or ten feet, the forward or forecastle deck having a windlass
or capstan for pulling the boat off bars, or warping through swift
water or over rapids.</p>

<p>Along each side of the cargo box ran a narrow walk, about
eighteen inches in width, with cleats nailed to the deck twenty-eight
or thirty inches apart, to prevent the feet of the crew from
slipping when poling upstream. Of the motive power of these
boats, Captain H. M. Chittenden, U. S. A., in a recent work
on the navigation of the Missouri River in early days, says:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p>"For the purposes of propulsion the boat was equipped with nearly all
the power appliances known to navigation, except steam. The cordelle
was the main reliance. This consists of a line nearly a thousand feet
long, fastened to the top of a mast which rose from the centre of the
boat to the height of nearly thirty feet. The boat was pulled along with
this line by men on shore. In order to hold the boat from swinging
around the mast, the line was connected with the bow of the boat by
means of a "bridle", a short auxiliary line fastened to a loop in the
bow, and to a ring through which the cordelle was passed. The bridle
prevented the boat from swinging under force of wind or current when
the speed was not great enough to accomplish this purpose by means of
the rudder. The object in having so long a line was to lessen the tendency
to draw the boat toward the shore; and the object in having it fastened
to the top of the mast was to keep it from dragging, and to enable it to
clear the brush along the bank. It took from twenty to forty men to
cordelle the keel boat along average stretches of the river [the Missouri],
and the work was always one of great difficulty."</p>
</div>

<p>For poling the men were provided with tough ash poles,
eighteen or twenty feet long, with a wooden or iron shoe or
socket to rest on the bottom of the river, and a crutch or knob
for the shoulder. In propelling the boat, ten or a dozen men
on each side thrust the foot of their poles into the bottom of the
river, and with the other end against their shoulders, walked
toward the stern of the boat, pushing it upstream at the same
rate of speed with which they walked toward the stern. As
each pair&mdash;one on each side of the boat&mdash;reached the stern,
they quickly recovered their poles, leaped to the roof of the cargo
box, and running forward jumped to the deck and replanted their
poles for a new turn of duty. By this means an even speed was
maintained, as in a crew of twenty there were always sixteen
men applying motive power, while four others were returning to
the bow for a new start. The writer, in his childhood, has stood
for hours on the banks of the St. Joseph River, in Niles, Michigan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
watching the crews of keel boats thus laboriously pushing their
craft up the river from St. Joseph, on the lake, to Niles, South
Bend, and Mishawaka. They were afterward to float back,
laden with flour in barrels, potatoes and apples in sacks, and all
the miscellaneous merchandise of the farm, destined for Detroit,
Buffalo, and the East, by way of the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>In addition to cordelling, as described above, the long line
was also used in warping the boat around difficult places where
the men could not follow the bank. This was accomplished by
carrying the line out ahead in the skiff as far as possible or convenient,
and making it fast to trees or rocks. The men on the
boat then hauled on the line, pulling the boat up until it reached
the object to which the line was attached. The boat was then
moored to the bank, or held with the poles until the line was again
carried ahead and made fast, when the process was repeated. In
this manner the greatest of up-river steamboatmen, Captain Daniel
Smith Harris, prosecuted his first voyage from Cincinnati to
Galena, in the year 1823. It probably required no more than
four or five days to run down the Ohio, on the spring flood, to
Cairo; from Cairo to Galena required two months of cordelling,
poling, and warping.</p>

<p>About the time the keel boat "Colonel Bumford" was passing
St. Louis, the steamer "Virginia" departed for the upper river
with a load of supplies for the United States military post at Fort
Snelling. She had among her passengers Major John Biddle
and Captain Joseph P. Russell, U. S. A., and Laurence Talliaferro,
United States Indian Agent for the Territory of Minnesota.
The "Virginia" arrived at Fort Snelling May 10, 1823,
the first boat propelled by steam to breast the waters of the upper
Mississippi. She was received with a salute of cannon from the
fort, and carried fear and consternation to the Indians, who
watched the smoke rolling from her chimney, the exhaust steam
shooting from her escape pipe with a noise that terrified them.
The "Virginia" was scarcely longer than the largest keel boat,
being about a hundred and twenty feet long, and twenty-two
feet beam. She had no upper cabin, the accommodations for the
passengers being in the hold, in the stern of the boat, with the
cargo-box covering so common to the keel boats of which she
herself was but an evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
What did the young steamboatman see on his voyage from
Cairo to Galena in 1823? In his later years, in speaking of this
trip, he said that where Cairo now stands there was but one log
building, a warehouse for the accommodation of keel-boat navigators
of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Cape Girardeau, St.
Genevieve, and Herculaneum were small settlements averaging
a dozen families each. St. Louis, which was built almost entirely
of frame buildings, had a population of about five thousand. The
levee was a ledge of rocks, with scarcely a fit landing place on
the whole frontage. Alton, Clarksville, and Louisiana were minor
settlements. What is now Quincy consisted of one log cabin only,
which was built and occupied by John Woods, who afterwards
became lieutenant-governor of the State of Illinois, and acting
governor. This intrepid pioneer was "batching it", being industriously
engaged in clearing a piece of land for farming purposes.
The only settler at Hannibal was one John S. Miller, a blacksmith,
who removed to Galena in the autumn of 1823. In later
years, Hannibal was to claim the honor of being the birthplace
of "Mark Twain", the historian of the lower Mississippi pilot
clans. The last farm house between St. Genevieve and Galena
was located at Cottonwood Prairie (now Canton), and was occupied
by one Captain White, who was prominently identified with
the early development of the Northwest. There was a government
garrison at Keokuk, which was then known as Fort Edwards,
and another at Fort Armstrong, now Rock Island. The settlement
at Galena consisted of about a dozen log cabins, a few
frame shanties, and a smelting furnace.</p>

<p>If he were looking only for the evidence of an advancing
civilization, the above probably covers about all he saw on his
trip. Other things he saw, however. The great river, flowing
in its pristine glory, "unvexed to the sea"; islands, set like emeralds
in the tawny flood, the trees and bushes taking on their
summer dress of green in the warm May sunshine; prairies
stretching away in boundless beauty, limited only by his powers
of vision. Later, as his craft stemmed the flood and advanced
up the river, he saw the hills beginning to encroach upon the
valley of the river, narrowing his view; later, the crags and
bastions of the bluffs of the upper river, beetling over the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
channel itself, and lending an added grandeur to the simple beauty
of the banks already passed.</p>

<p>His unaccustomed eyes saw the wickyups and tepees of the
Indians scattered among the islands and on the lowlands, the
hunters of the tribe exchanging the firelock for the spear and net
as they sought to reap the water for its harvest of returning fish.
It was all new to the young traveller, who was later to become
the best known steamboatman of the upper river, the commander
of a greater number of different steamboats than any of his
compeers, and who was to know the river, in all its meanderings
and in all its moods, better than any other who ever sailed it&mdash;Daniel
Smith Harris, of Galena, Illinois.</p>

<i>A Versatile Commander; Wreck of the "Equator"</i></h2>
</div>

<p>While some men were to be found on the Mississippi in the
sixties who did not hesitate to avow themselves religious, and
whose lives bore witness that they were indeed Christians, the
combination of a Methodist preacher and a steamboat captain
was one so incongruous that it was unique, and so far as I know,
without a parallel on the river. There appeared to be no great
incompatibility between the two callings, however, as they were
represented in the person of Captain Asa B. Green. He was a
good commander, as I had personal opportunity of observing at
the time of the incident described in this chapter; and a few
years later, when the great drama of the Civil War was on, I
again had an opportunity to observe Captain Green in his alternate
rôle of minister of the gospel, he having been appointed chaplain
of the Thirtieth Wisconsin Infantry in which I served as a
private soldier. In this capacity he showed rare good sense and
practical wisdom. He preached to the boys when a favorable
opportunity offered on a Sunday, when there was not too much
else going on; but his sermons were short, and as practical as
was the man himself.</p>

<p>Of his conversion, or early life, on the river as a missionary,
little seemed to be known by any one whom I ever met. He ran
the Chippewa in the early days, during the summer months, and
in the winter did missionary work among the lumbermen, following
them to their camps in the woods, preaching and ministering
to them; not as an alien, and in an academic fashion, but as one
"to the manner born". It is likely that his young manhood was
passed on the river and in the lumber camps, and when he was
converted his thoughts turned naturally to the needs of these
particular classes, for none knew better than he just how great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
their needs were. Of how or where he was ordained to preach
I know nothing; but as he was in good standing with the Methodist
conference there is no question as to the regularity of his
commission. His master's certificate authorizing him to command
a steamboat certified to his standing as a river man.</p>

<p>Probably he divided his time between commanding a steamboat
and preaching the gospel, two callings so dissimilar, because
the river work was quite remunerative, financially, while the other
was quite the reverse. It probably took all the money he earned
during the summer to support himself and his philanthropies
during the winter. If his expenditures among the boys in the
lumber camps were as free-handed as were his gifts to poor, sick,
wounded, and homesick soldiers during his service with the Thirtieth
Wisconsin during the war, it would easily require the seven
months' pay of a river captain to sustain the other five months'
liberality of the quondam preacher. Certain it is, that after three
years' service as chaplain he came out as poor as he went in&mdash;in
money. If the respect and high regard of his brother officers were
worth anything; or better yet, if the love and gratitude of hundreds
of plain boys in blue, privates in the ranks, might be counted
as wealth, then Captain Green was rich indeed. And that was
what he did count as real wealth. To be hugged by one of his
"boys" at a Grand Army reunion, one whom he had nursed back
to life in an army hospital by his optimistic cheerfulness and
Christian hope and comfort&mdash;was to him better than gold or
silver. He has gone to his reward; and whether he now is telling
the "old, old story" to other men in other spheres, or pacing
the deck of a spectre steamboat on the River of Life&mdash;whichever
may be his work&mdash;beyond a peradventure he is doing that
work well.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1858, in April, in his capacity as captain,
Asa B. Green was commanding the steamer "Equator". She was
a stern-wheel boat of about a hundred and twenty tons, plying
on the St. Croix between Prescott and St. Croix Falls. The
lake opened early that season, but the opening was followed by
cold and stormy weather, with high winds. There was some
sort of celebration at Stillwater, and as was customary in those
days an excursion was organized at Hastings and Prescott to
attend the "blow-out". About three hundred people crowded the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
little steamer, men, women, and children. She started off up
the lake in the morning, fighting her way against a high wind
right out of the north. Charley Jewell was pilot, the writer
was "cub", John Lay was chief engineer. I have forgotten the
name of the mate, but whatever may have been his name or nationality,
he was the man for the place. He was every inch a man,
as was the captain on the roof, and so in fact was every officer
on the boat.</p>

<p>Everything went well until we had cleared Catfish bar, at
Afton. From there to Stillwater is about twelve miles, due north.
The wind had full sweep the whole length of this reach. The
lake is two and a half miles wide just above Catfish bar. The
sweep of the wind had raised a great sea, and the heavily-laden
boat crawled ahead into the teeth of the blizzard&mdash;for it began
to snow as well as blow. We had progressed very slowly, under
an extra head of steam, for about three miles above the bar, when
the port "rock-shaft", or eccentric rod, broke with a snap, and
the wheel stopped instantly; in fact, John Lay had his hand on
the throttle wheel when the rod broke, and in an instant had shut
off steam to save his cylinders.</p>

<p>As soon as the wheel stopped the boat fell off into the trough
of the sea. The first surge caught her on the quarter, before
she had fully exposed her broadside, but it rolled her lee guards
under water, and made every joint in her upper works creak
and groan. The second wave struck her full broadside on. The
tables had just been set for dinner. As the boat rolled down,
under stress of wind and wave, the tables were thrown to leeward
with a crash of broken glass and china that seemed to be the
end of all things with the "Equator". Women and children
screamed, and many women fainted. Men turned white, and some
went wild, scrambling and fighting for life preservers. Several
persons&mdash;they could hardly be called men&mdash;had two, and even
three, strapped about their bodies, utterly ignoring the women
and children in their abjectly selfish panic. The occasion brought
out all the human nature there was in the crowd, and some
that was somewhat baser than human.</p>

<p>As a whole, however, the men behaved well, and set about
doing what they could to insure the safety of the helpless ones
before providing for their own safety. It has always been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
satisfaction to me that I had this opportunity, while a boy, to
witness and take part in an accident which, while it did not
result in the loss of a single life, had every element of great
danger, and the imminent probability of the loss of hundreds of
lives. It was an object lesson in what constituted manhood, self-reliant
courage, official faithfulness, and the prompt application
of ready expedients for the salvation of the boat.</p>

<p>When the crash came, Mr. Lay called up through the
speaking-tube, stating the nature and extent of the accident. Mr.
Jewell reported it to Captain Green, who ordered him to go
to the cabin and attempt to allay the fright of the passengers, and
to prevent a panic. As he started, Jewell ordered me to remain
in the pilot house and listen for calls from the engine-room.</p>

<p>In the meantime the deck hands, or many of them, were
in a panic, some of them on their knees on the forecastle, making
strong vows of religious reformation should they come safe to
land. This was a commendable attitude, both of body and spirit,
had there been nothing else to do. In this particular province
it would seem that much might have been expected from a captain
who was also a preacher. On the contrary his manner of meeting
the exigency was decidedly and profoundly out of drawing with
preconceived notions of what might be expected from such a
combination. An old man from Prescott, the richest man in
town, and also one of the meanest, nearly seventy years old, crept
up the companion way to the upper deck, and clasping Captain
Green about the legs cried: "Save me! for God's sake save me!
and I will give you a thousand dollars"!</p>

<p>"Get away you d&mdash;&mdash;d cowardly old cur. Let go of me
and get down below or I will throw you overboard", was Captain
Green's exhortation as he yanked him to his feet by his collar and
kicked him to the stairway. Both the language and the action
were uncanonical in the extreme; but then, he was acting for
the time in his capacity as captain, and not as preacher. I didn't
laugh at the time, for I was doing some thinking on my own
hook about the salvation business; and my estimate of the chances
for getting to the shore, two miles away, in that wind and sea,
was not flattering. I have laughed many times since, however,
and wondered what the old miser thought of the orthodoxy of
Chaplain Green when he answered his prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
The deck hands also met with a surprise from the mate, and
that in less than a minute. Men think fast in such an emergency,
especially those schooled amid dangers and quickened in mind and
body by recurring calls for prompt action. A dozen seas had
not struck the "Equator" before the mate was on the forecastle,
driving the panic-stricken deck hands to work. Dropping the two
long spars to the deck, with the assistance of the carpenter and
such men as had gathered their wits together, he lashed them
firmly together at each end. Then bending on a strong piece
of line extending from end to end, and doubled, he made fast
the main hawser, or snubbing line, to the middle, or bight of the
rope attached to the spars, and then launched the whole overboard,
making a "sea-anchor" that soon brought the bow of the vessel
head to sea, and eased the racking roll of the hull, steadying the
craft so that there was little further danger of her sinking. In
the ten or fifteen minutes that it had taken to get the drag built
and overboard, the waves had swept over the lower deck and into
the hold, until there was a foot of water weighing her down,
which the bilge pumps operated by the "doctor" were unable to
throw out as fast as it came in. Had it continued to gain for
fifteen minutes longer, the boat would have gone to the bottom
with all on board. The drag saved the vessel; the coolness and
quickness of the mate and carpenter were the salvation of the
steamer and its great load of people.</p>

<p>In the meantime other incidents were occurring, that made
a lasting impression upon my mind. I did not witness them
myself, but I learned of them afterwards. All this time I stood
at the side of the useless wheel in the pilot house, listening for
sounds from the engine-room. Mr. Lay was doing all that was
possible to remedy the break. He cut off the steam from the
useless cylinder, and with his assistant and the firemen, was at
work disconnecting the pitman, with the intent to try to work
the wheel with one cylinder, which would have been an impossibility
in that sea. In fact it would have been impossible under
any circumstances, for the large wheel of a stern-wheel boat is
built to be operated by two engines; there is not power enough in
either one alone to more than turn it over, let alone driving the
steamboat. When the crash came, Engineer Lay's wife, who was
on board as a passenger, ran immediately to the engine-room to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
with her husband when the worst should come. He kissed her
as she came, and said: "There's a dear, brave, little woman.
Run back to the cabin and encourage the other women. I must
work. Good-bye". And the "little woman"&mdash;for she was a
little woman, and a brave little woman, also&mdash;without another
word gave her husband a good-bye kiss, and wiping away the
tears, went back to the cabin and did more than all the others
to reassure the frightened, fainting women and little children&mdash;the
very antithesis of the craven old usurer who had crept on his
knees begging for a little longer lease of a worthless life.</p>

<p>It took an hour or more to drift slowly, stern first, diagonally
across and down the lake to the shore above Glenmont, on the
Wisconsin side, where she struck and swung broadside onto the
beach. The men carried the women ashore through four feet of
water, and in another hour the cabin was blown entirely off the
sunken hull, and the boat was a total wreck. Her bones are
there to-day, a striking attestation of the power of wind and wave,
even upon so small a body of water as Lake St. Croix.</p>

<p>Big fires were built from the wreckage to warm the wet and
benumbed people. Runners were sent to nearby farm houses for
teams, as well as to Hudson, seven or eight miles way. Many
of the men walked home to Prescott and Hastings. Captain
Green, who owned the boat, stayed with his crew to save what
he could from the wreck, in which he lost his all; but he had
only words of thanksgiving that not a life had been lost while
under his charge. Through it he was cool and cheerful, devoting
himself to reassuring his passengers, as soon as the drag was in
place, and giving orders for getting the women and children
ashore as soon as the boat should strike. His only deviation from
perfect equipoise was exhibited in his treatment of the old man,
a notoriously mean, and exacting money-lender, with whom he had
no sympathy at any time, and no patience at a time like this.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_25"></a>Chapter XXV<br />
<i>A Stray Nobleman</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Of the many men whom it was my good fortune to meet
while on the river as a boy, or as a young man, there was none
who came nearer to filling the bill as a nobleman than Robert
C. Eden, whose memory suggests the title of this chapter. Just
what constitutes a nobleman in the college of heraldry, I am not
qualified to assert. "Bob" Eden, as his friends fondly called him&mdash;Captain
Eden, as he was known on the river, or Major Eden
as he was better known in the closing days of the War of Secession&mdash;was
the son of an English baronet. There were several
other sons who had had the luck to be born ahead of "Bob",
and his chance for attaining to the rank and title of baronet
was therefore extremely slim. However, his father was able to
send him to Oxford, from which ancient seat of learning he was
graduated with honors. As a younger son he was set apart for
the ministry, where he finally landed after sowing his wild oats,
which he did in a gentlemanly and temperate manner that comported
well with the profession for which he was destined, all
his studies having been along theological lines. The <i>wanderlust</i>
was in his blood, however, and he declined taking holy orders
until he had seen something of the unholy world outside. Accordingly
he took the portion due him, or which his father gave
him, and departed for Canada. Not finding things just to his
taste in that British appanage, possibly not rapid enough for a
divinity student, he promptly crossed the line and began making
himself into a Yankee, in all except citizenship.</p>

<p>In his wanderings he finally reached Oshkosh, attracted no
doubt by the euphony of the name, which has made the little "saw
dust city of the Fox" one of the best known towns, by title, in
the world. If there was any one place more than another calculated
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
to educate and instruct an embryo clergyman in the ways
of the world, and a particularly wicked world at that, it was
Oshkosh before the war. That he saw some of the "fun" which
the boys enjoyed in those days was evidenced by the fund of stories
relating to that place and that era, which he had in stock in later
years.</p>

<p>I do not know how long he remained there on his first
visit. When I made his acquaintance he was journeying up the
river by easy stages on a little side-wheel steamer, having both
wheels on a single shaft&mdash;a type of steamboat which I had
known on the St. Joseph River in Michigan, but which was not
common on the Mississippi. This class was used on the Fox and
Wolf Rivers, and on Lake Winnebago. Captain Eden had bought
this little steamboat, of perhaps eighty tons burden, for the purpose
of exploring at his leisure the upper Mississippi and its tributaries.
He had sailed up the Fox River to Portage, through the canal
to the Wisconsin, and down that stream to the Mississippi, and
had reached Prescott, where I met him. He wanted to go up the
St. Croix to the Falls, stopping at all the towns, and at places
where there were no towns, at his own sweet will. First-class
pilots were getting six hundred dollars a month wages in those
days. Eden's boat was not worth two months' pay of such a pilot,
and he was on the lookout for a cheaper man when he found me.</p>

<p>His crew consisted of himself, acting in the capacity of
captain and first and second mates; an engineer and fireman in
one person; a deck hand, and a cook. The cook is named last, but
he was by no means the least personage aboard the "Enterprise".
As this was a sort of holiday excursion, the cook was about the
most important official about the boat. He was fully up in his
business, and could cook all kinds of game and fish to perfection,
as well as the ordinary viands of civilization. It was a privilege
to be catered to by this master of his art. The captain had under
him, therefore, three men, in addition to the pilot for temporary
service from time to time as he journeyed up the river. The
"Enterprise" was not a speedy boat. She could make four or
five miles an hour upstream if the current was not too strong, and
double that downstream if the current was strong enough. She
had no upper cabin answering to the "boiler deck" of the river
boats&mdash;only a little box of a pilot house on the roof, big enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
to contain a little wheel and the man who turned it. This wheel
was only about a third the diameter of a real steamboat wheel,
and instead of wheel-ropes it had chains, large enough for a man-of-war.
When the wheel was put hard up or hard down, the
chains responded with a series of groans and squeaks not unmusical,
but new and novel to one used only to the noiseless operation of
the well-oiled wheel-ropes of the river steamers. The chains
were part of the fire-proof outfit required by regulations on the
great lakes. The "Enterprise" was from Winnebago. To pull
the little three-foot wheel hard down, and hold the stumpy little
steamer up to a reef from which she wanted to run away, required
the expenditure of as much muscle as was demanded to cramp a
four-hundred ton steamer over the same bar by the use of the
larger wheel and easier-running wheel-ropes.</p>

<p>The cabin of the "Enterprise" was all aft of the paddle-boxes.
It was so divided as to afford sleeping quarters for the crew at
the forward part, next the engine, while Captain Eden occupied
the after part, which was fitted up as a boudoir, with a little side
niche, in which he slept. His pointer dog and his retriever also
slept in the same niche. There was a fine library in the cabin&mdash;not
a great number of books, but the best books, some English,
some French, some German, and several Greek and Latin, for
Captain Eden was a polyglot in his reading. There was also a
gun rack with several rifles, three or four shot guns of big and
little calibre, and a pair of duelling pistols. Likewise there were
rods, reels, landing nets, and fly-hooks without number, rubber
boots and mackintoshes for rough weather, and all the paraphernalia
of a gentleman sportsman. It was evident at a glance
that Captain Eden was not in financial straits, and it was equally
evident that he was not steamboating for profit.</p>

<p>As I knew the St. Croix River well enough to navigate it
with a far larger boat than Captain Eden's, and in addition knew
also a great deal more about the haunts of bear, deer, prairie
chickens, brook trout, and indeed all species of fish inhabiting the
waters of the Mississippi River and its tributaries; and further,
had a speaking and dining acquaintance with sundry red men,
both Sioux and Chippewa, with whom Captain Eden also wished
to become acquainted for purposes of original investigation and
study, I was deemed a valuable acquisition. On my side a reasonable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
salary as pilot, with a free run of the guns, fishing tackle,
and books was an attractive presentation of the case, and it took
but a short time to arrange the details of an engagement.</p>

<p>A day's work on this model craft consisted in steering the
boat five or six miles up or down the river or lake to the most
inviting hunting or fishing grounds, or to the vicinity of an Indian
camp, finding a sheltered place in which to tie up, and then taking
a tramp of ten or a dozen miles after deer, bear, or prairie chickens,
or a walk of three or four miles up some favorite trout stream,
and fishing back to the boat. In that day bear and deer abounded
within a very few miles of Prescott, Hudson, or other points.
Indeed, as late as 1876 bears were quite common about River Falls,
one or two having come right into the village to pick up young
pigs and lambs; and deer were also numerous within a few miles
of the same place.</p>

<p>This in itself was an ideal occupation. But added to it was
the privilege of an intimate association with, and the conversation
of, a man from across the ocean, whose father was a baronet, who
had himself been schooled in Oxford, who had lived in London,
and Paris, and Berlin, and had seen men and things of whom
and which I had read in books, but which were all very far
removed from the backwoods farm of Michigan where I was
born, and from the still wilder surroundings of the upper Mississippi
in the middle fifties.</p>

<p>I had been a persistent reader from the time I had learned
my letters, and was now seventeen years old. The volumes to
which I had had access were principally school books, with here
and there a history or biography, and an occasional novel. At
one period only, while working in the printing office, had I the
run of a well-chosen library belonging to the lawyer-editor. Here,
however, was something better than books. I could question this
man on points that the books might have passed over, and he
could answer. His mind was quick, his powers of observation
trained, his brain well stored with the lore of books&mdash;history,
poetry, eloquence, and in addition he had seen much of the world
which lay so far beyond and outside the life of a Western-bred
country lad. It was better than any school I had ever attended,
and he was a rare teacher. He didn't realize that he was teaching,
but I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
It was not a case of absorption alone on my part, however.
In my own field I had much to communicate&mdash;the lore of woods
and streams, the ways of the red men, the moods and legends of
the Great River, matters which seemed of little value to me, but
which this stranger from an older civilization was as solicitous to
hear about as I was to listen to the stories of his larger life.
While I deemed myself fortunate indeed in making the acquaintance
of this cosmopolitan man of the world, I was pleased to
know that there were some things that I knew better than my
more widely-travelled employer. One of these things, insignificant
in itself, was the fact that the pilot could catch ten trout
to the captain's one, after giving him all possible advantages of
first chances at good "holes", and likely riffles, and the first chance
in wading ahead down the stream. This was for a long time
one of the mysteries to the captain&mdash;why a trout would not bite
at one man's hook just as readily as at another's, when they were
exactly alike as to lures, whether natural or artificial. The fact
remains that there is a difference in the manner in which you
approach them with the temptation; until you get the "hang of
the thing" you will not catch the trout that the more astute disciple
of the good Walton catches out of the same stream, in
the same hour.</p>

<p>Thrown together as we both were on board the boat and on
these excursions, the relation of employer and servant was soon
forgotten, and the closer and more intimate relation of friend to
friend was established, a relation which lasted as long as Captain
Eden remained in America. Two months were passed in idling
along the St. Croix, in hunting, fishing, exploring, studying the
beautiful, if not grand, rock formations of the Dalles, and in
visiting the Indians in their haunts around Wood Lake and the
upper St. Croix. Then Captain Eden turned the prow of his
little steamboat toward home, descending the river to Prairie du
Chien, ascending the Wisconsin, portaging through the canal to
the Fox, and thence steaming down to Oshkosh. Disposing of his
steamboat there, he entered the office of the <i>Northwestern</i> newspaper,
first as a reporter and later as an editorial writer. Not
many suburban newspapers fifty years ago could boast of an
Oxonian among their editorial writers. But very few people outside
of his immediate friends ever knew that the quiet man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
represented the <i>Northwestern</i> was either an Oxonian or the son
of an English baronet.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1863 the men of the North were gathering
themselves together for the mightiest struggle of modern times&mdash;the
battle summer of 1864. In Wisconsin, the Thirty-seventh
Regiment of Infantry was in process of enrollment, and the whilom
Englishman was one of those engaged in recruiting for this regiment,
putting his money as well as his time into the work. Captain
Eden was so successful in enlisting men for the service, that
when the regiment was organized he was commissioned as major.
In the strenuous days immediately following the battle of Cold
Harbor the writer again met his old employer. The difference
in rank between the enlisted man and the commissioned officer was
no bar to the recognition of the former friendship existing between
the steamboat captain and his pilot&mdash;friendship broadened and
strengthened by companionship in woods and along streams by
mutual interest and respect.</p>

<p>Major Robert C. Eden, or "Bob" Eden, as he was called at
the front, was a model officer. His family had for generations
been furnishing officers for the British army, and the fighting
blood ran in his veins. His regiment was in the hottest of the
fight at the Petersburg mine disaster, and he was at the head of
his men. Through all the long siege following the first repulse,
from June, 1864, until April, 1865, constantly under fire, he
proved the metal that was in his composition. When he left
England to seek his fortune, he was engaged to a Scotch lassie
from one of the old families of the borderland. After a summer's
experience of Yankee warfare, pitted against the "Johnnies" under
Lee, Longstreet, Gordon, and Wise&mdash;men of equal courage,
tenacity, and fighting ability&mdash;"Bob" concluded that another
summer of the same sort as the last might prove too much for
him, and that he might lose the number of his mess, as hundreds
of his comrades had in the summer just closed. If he hoped or
wished to leave a widow when he was called, he had better clinch
the contract at once. And so he did.</p>

<p>His fiancée, who also came of fighting stock, promptly responded
to the challenge and came overseas to meet her hero.
They were married across a stump in the rear of Fort Haskell
(Fort Hell, the boys called it, as opposed to Fort Damnation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
immediately opposite, in the Confederate line of works). Chaplain
Hawes read the full Church of England service for the occasion,
the regiment formed in hollow square about them, and the
brigade band played the wedding march, while an occasional shell
from the Confederate works sang overhead. Major-General O.
B. Wilcox, commanding the division, gave away the bride, and
all went merry despite the warlike surroundings.</p>

<p>After the war, Major Eden returned to Oshkosh and resumed
his editorial labors, in which he persisted for several years. Finally
the home hunger came upon him, or perhaps more strongly
upon his wife. The wild Western society of the swiftest town of
its size in the state was not so much to her liking as that of the
slower but more refined surroundings of the land of her birth.
Severing all ties, business and otherwise, they returned to England.
Once there the influence of English kin and early associations was
too strong to permit of his return to Yankee land, and Major
"Bob" assumed the canonical robes which had so long awaited
his broad shoulders.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>he ministers at the altar of the Prince of Peace, the calling toward
which his early education tended. His excursion into the wilds
of the Northwest, his steamboat trip up the Great River, his
experience as the editor of a frontier newspaper, and his service
in an alien army&mdash;all must have had an influence in broadening
his view and enriching his preaching.</p>

<p>One incident which occurred in our rambles was somewhat
amusing. We had tied up in the mouth of the Kinnickinnic
River, and had walked up the stream some eight or ten miles to
the little village of River Falls, where I was very well acquainted,
and where the trout fishing was excellent. It had been Eden's
request that I should introduce him simply as Captain Eden, without
going into any particulars of parentage, education, or nationality.
As he wore a suit of Scotch tweeds somewhat the worse
for wear from numerous excursions after deer, prairie chickens,
and trout, there was nothing suggestive of the Oxonian about him.
In River Falls lived the only really educated man of that locality&mdash;a
graduate from Yale, both in law and divinity. We called upon
him and while discussing the country, its beauty, its game, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
its fishing, Captain Eden was toying with a book of Greek tragedies,
that lay open on the table. His apparent interest in the
strange characters in which the book was printed tempted the
scholar to remark, possibly with a slightly ironical inflection:</p>

<p>"I presume you read Greek on the river, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes", was Captain Eden's response, "I am very fond
of the Greek tragedies, and I have read a good deal to keep in
practice. I like this passage that you were reading when we
came in."</p>

<p>Taking the book, Captain Eden read in a beautifully modulated
voice, and with probably a perfect accent, the passage which
the scholar had marked, and which he had been reading when
we called. I say, "probably perfect accent". I had never seen
a printed page of Greek before, much less had I ever heard it
read as fluently as I could read English. The <i>amende</i> which the
scholar instantly made, and the praises which he bestowed on the
marine prodigy who captained a little steamboat on the river, wore
rough clothes, and read Greek like a native, convinced me that his
ministerial preparation had been laid upon solid foundations, and
that his accent was above criticism, out in that country at least.</p>

<p>It was during this visit to River Falls that Captain Eden
made the acquaintance of Ellsworth Burnett, another nobleman,
born among the hills of Vermont, at whose farm we were guests
while loading our baskets with trout from the south fork of the
Kinnickinnic, which flowed through his farm and past his door.
The friendship thus begun undoubtedly led to Eden's going into
the army, for Burnett was largely instrumental in raising one
of the companies of the regiment in which Major Eden was
commissioned, himself going out as a captain, and returning at the
close of the war as major.</p>

<i>In War Time</i></h2>
</div>

<p>In the early spring of 1861 the "Fanny Harris" was chartered
by the United States government to go to Fort Ridgeley, up the
Minnesota River, and bring down the battery of light artillery
stationed at that post, known as the Sherman Battery, Major
T. W. Sherman having been in command long enough to have
conferred his name upon the organization, and by that it was
known at the time of which I write. It is three hundred miles
from St. Paul to Fort Ridgeley by the river; as a crow flies, the
distance is about half of that. A little more than one year after
our visit there was business at and near the fort for many crows&mdash;the
gruesome occupation of picking the bones of a thousand white
people (men, women, and children) murdered by the crafty Sioux,
who saw in the withdrawal of the troops an opportunity to avenge
all their wrongs, real or imaginary, and to regain the lands which
had been sold under treaty, or which had been stolen from them
by the fast encroaching white population of the state.</p>

<p>The Minnesota River is the worst twisted water course in
the West. No other affluent of the Mississippi can show as many
bends to the mile throughout its course. It is a series of curves
from start to finish, the river squirming its way through an alluvial
prairie from Beaver Falls, the head of navigation, to Mendota at
its mouth. Up this crooked stream it was the problem to force
the largest boat that had ever navigated it, and a stern-wheeler
at that. At the time the trip was made, there was a nineteen-foot
rise in the river, resulting from the melting of the snow after an
exceptionally hard winter. This precluded any danger of touching
bottom anywhere, but it added ten fold to the difficulties of navigating
a two hundred-foot steamboat around the short bends for
the reason that the water did not follow the regular channel, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
cut right across bends and points, so that most of the time the
current was setting squarely across the river, catching the steamer
broadside on, and driving her into the woods, and when there
holding her as in a vise. Being a stern-wheeler it was impossible,
by going ahead on one wheel and backing on the other, as would
have been done by a side-wheeler, to keep her head clear of the
bank. All this work had to be done by the men at the wheel,
and they very soon found their work cut out for them, in handling
the boat by the steering wheel and rudders alone. We had
a Minnesota River pilot on board to assist our men in steering; it
was an impossibility to lose one's self, so that his services were
confined almost exclusively to steering, and not to piloting, in its
true sense. We also had an army officer from Fort Snelling on
board, to see that all possible speed was made. His orders were
to "push her through" at whatever cost, regardless of damage.</p>

<p>The boat was coaled at St. Paul for the round trip, for the
woodyards were all under water, and the cord wood was adrift
on its way to St. Louis, derelict. From the time we entered the
river at Fort Snelling, two men were at the wheel all the time.
I was sent to the engine-room, my experience as a "cub" engineer
rendering my services there of more importance for the time being
than in the pilot house. I stood at one engine all day, while one
of the firemen detailed for the purpose stood at the other, to "ship
up", to back, or come ahead. There were no unnecessary bells
rung. If we were going ahead and the stopping bell rang, followed
by the backing bell we threw the rods on to their "hooks",
and the engineer gave her full steam astern. This was usually
followed by a crash forward, as the boat was thrown broadside,
with almost full speed ahead, into the woods, after having struck
one of the cross currents either unguardedly, or else one which was
too strong in any case for the wheelsmen to meet and overcome by
the rudder alone. If it chanced that the bank was overhung by
trees, the forward cabin lost an additional portion of its ornamentation.</p>

<p>In nearly every such instance it was necessary to get the yawl
overboard, and with four men at the oars and a steersman sculling
astern, pull to the opposite side of the river and get a line fast to
a tree. The line was then taken to the steam capstan and the
boat would be hauled out of a position from which it would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
been impossible to release her by the engines and wheel alone.
This work was kept up from daylight until dark, and when the
four men came down from the pilot house they were apt to be so
exhausted that they could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>The boat tied up where night overtook her. In the engine-room,
as soon as the day's run was ended, all hands set to work&mdash;engineers,
"strikers" and firemen&mdash;to replace the lost and broken
wheel-arms and buckets. This was a hard and dangerous job, for
the water ran a raging torrent, six or eight miles an hour, and the
nights were dark and rainy. It was precarious business, this getting
out on the fantails, with only the dim light of half a dozen
lanterns, unscrewing refractory nuts and bolts with a big
monkey-wrench, and in the meantime holding on by one's legs
only, over such a mill tail. Everybody engaged in this work understood
fully that if he ever fell into the water it was the end of
all things to him, for he would have been swept away in the darkness
and drowned in a minute. There was no dry land for him
to reach in any direction, the river sweeping across the country
five or ten feet deep in every direction. It was usually far past
midnight when the temporary and necessary repairs were completed,
and then the engine-room force "turned in" to get three or four
hours sleep before beginning another day as full of work and
danger as the preceding.</p>

<p>All this time the army man either stood on the roof with the
captain, dodging falling spars, chimneys, or limbs of trees, or at the
wheel with the pilots, or paced the engine-room, and urged speed,
speed, speed. "The United States will put a new cabin on your
boat. Never mind that. Keep your wheel turning and your
machinery in working order. We must have troops in Washington
at once, or there will be no United States." It is fair to
say that every man on the boat worked as though his life depended
upon his exertions. Whatever may have been their political
sympathies, there was nothing on the surface to indicate other
than the determination to get that battery to La Crosse in the
shortest possible time.</p>

<p>That army officer was the epitome of concentrated energy.
He was a captain and quartermaster, and representing the United
States, was practically supreme on board. He had his limitations
as a steamboatman, but thanks to the splendid equipment which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
his government had given him at West Point, coupled with the
experience he had gained during many years' service in the West in
moving troops, Indians, and supplies by steamboat, he had a pretty
good idea of what needed to be done, and could judge very clearly
whether the men in charge were competent, and were doing things
in the right way and to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances such a close censorship of the
officers and crew would not have been maintained, nor would it
have been tolerated if suggested. But at this time everything
was at white heat. Fort Sumter had fallen. Men were stirred
as never before in this country, and officers of the regular army
particularly, who knew better than any others the gravity of the
impending conflict, were keyed up to the highest tension by the
responsibility placed upon them. On the other hand the officers
of our boat were likewise burdened with the responsibility of safely
taking a big vessel hundreds of miles up a narrow and crooked
river, just now covered with floating drift of every description,
with undermined trees falling at every mile. They were spurred
on by the thought that the difference of a day, or even of a few
hours, might determine the loss of the nation's capital. Under
these circumstances the insistence of the army man was passed by
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Near Belle Plaine a council was called to decide whether
an attempt should be made to force a passage through the thin
strip of timber that fringed the river bank. If successful, this would
permit of sailing the boat a straight course for ten miles across
a submerged prairie, thus cutting off twenty miles of crooked and
arduous navigation. The Minnesota River pilot was sure that
we would meet with no obstacles after passing the fringe of timber&mdash;not
a house, barn, or haystack, as all that somewhat unusual
class of obstructions to a steamboat had been carried away by the
great flood. After discussing the plan in all its bearings, it was
decided to try it as soon as a narrow and weak place could be
found in the timber belt.</p>

<p>Such a place, where the willows and cottonwoods were the
thinnest and smallest in diameter, was chosen for the attempt.
The boat, by reason of its length, could not be pointed straight
at the "hurdle", as the pilots facetiously dubbed it, but a quartering
cut was decided upon. The jack staff had long ago been carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
away; the spars and derricks were housed below, and a large portion
of the forward roof was already missing. It was decided,
therefore, that a little more banging would count for nothing.
Everybody was cautioned to stand clear of the guards, and look
out for himself. A big head of steam was accumulated, and then
with two men at the wheel and everybody hanging on, the "Fanny
Harris" was pointed at the opposite shore, with its lining of woods,
and the throttle thrown wide open. She jumped across the river
in a minute and dove into the young timber, crushing trees six
inches in diameter flat on either side; the water-soaked, friable soil
affording no secure holding ground for the roots, which added
greatly to our chances of success. The boat plunged through all
right, with little damage, until the wheel came in over the bank.
Then there was music. Many of the trees were only bent out of
perpendicular, and when the hull passed clear these trees rebounded
to more or less perpendicular positions&mdash;enough so as to get into
the wheel and very nearly strip it of its buckets, together with a
dozen of the wheel-arms. The pilots heard the crash and rang
to stop. The engineers knew more about the damage than the
pilots, but would not have stopped the engine of their own accord
had the whole stern of the boat gone with it. It wasn't their
business to stop without orders, and they knew their business.</p>

<p>When the wheel stopped turning, the boat stopped. The
problem then was, to get the boat through the remaining hundred
feet or more. This was done by carrying the big anchor ahead,
and taking the cable to the steam capstan. The boat was dragged
"out of the woods", and all hands turned to replace the smashed
buckets. As soon as they were in place we steamed gaily up the
current, over the prairie, clean-swept of fences, stacks, and barns,
only a few isolated houses, built on the higher knolls, having
escaped the flood. At the upper end of the prairie a weak place
was found, and with a clear start in the open water the boat was
driven through the fringe of timber, clear into the open channel,
without stopping, and this time with but little injury to the
wheel.</p>

<p>Couriers had been sent ahead from Fort Snelling, by pony express,
to the commanding officer of the fort, to have his battery
ready to embark as soon as the boat should arrive. It had taken
us four days to run the three hundred miles, and it was a dilapidated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
steamboat that at last made fast at the landing place at the foot
of the bluff, under the shadow of Fort Ridgeley.</p>

<p>The fort was ideally situated for defense against Indian
attacks, for which, of course, it was alone built. It would appear,
however, that its builders had little idea that it would ever be put
to the test&mdash;such a test as it was subjected to a little more than
a year after our visit. It was located on a sort of promontory
formed by the bluff on the side next the river, and a deep ravine
on the other. On the third side of the triangle lay the open
prairie, stretching away for miles, with only a slight sprinkling
of scrub oaks to obstruct the view. The barracks, stables, and
storehouse (frame structures) were built up solidly on two sides
of this triangle, next the ravines, the windowless backs of the
buildings forming the walls of the fort. Toward the prairie, the
most vulnerable face, the buildings did not fully cover the front,
there being two or three wide openings between those that formed
that side of the defenses. These openings were covered by cannon
of the battery which garrisoned the fort.</p>

<p>When the battery embarked for the East there were left only
two or three small howitzers in charge of a sergeant of artillery,
and it was these little pieces that saved the garrison from massacre
in August, 1862, when the fort was for many days beleaguered by
eight hundred Sioux Indians under the chief, Little Crow, leader
of the uprising in Minnesota in that year. Undoubtedly the respect
that Indians have for any sort of cannon had as much to do
with their repulse as did the actual punishment inflicted by the
howitzers, however well-served they may have been. I have a
letter somewhere, written by a distant cousin who was a colonel
in the Confederate army, relating that they had several thousand
Indians in the Confederate army upon going into the battle of
Prairie Grove, and from them they expected great things. When
the "Yanks" opened with their artillery the sound alone brought
the Indian contingent to a stand. When the gunners got the range
and began to drop shells among them, the red men remembered
that they had pressing business in the Indian Territory, and it is
Colonel Merrick's opinion that they did not stop running until
they reached their tepees. It is his opinion also that as soldiers, for
use in war where Anglo-Saxons are debating grave questions of
state with twelve pounders, they are not worth a red copper.</p>

<i>At Fort Ridgeley</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The officer in command of the battery when it left Fort
Ridgeley was Captain and Brevet Major John C. Pemberton, U.
S. A. He had won his brevet by gallant services in action at
Monterey and Molino del Rey. He accompanied the battery as
far as Washington, where he resigned (April 29, 1861), and
tendered his sword to the Confederacy. He was rapidly promoted
until he reached a major-generalcy in that army, and had the distinguished
honor to surrender his army of thirty thousand men at
Vicksburg to Major General Ulysses S. Grant, July 3, 1863.
Pemberton was born in Pennsylvania, being appointed to the army
from that state, so that he had not even the flimsy excuse of serving
his state in thus betraying his country.</p>

<p>The battery was known as the Buena Vista Battery, or still
better as Sherman's. But Major Sherman, although long its commander,
was not with it at the time we transferred it down the
river. Major Sherman rendered distinguished service during the
war, and retired (December 31, 1870) with the rank of major-general.
Two other officers were with the battery&mdash;First Lieutenant
Romeyn Ayres, and Second Lieutenant Beekman Du Barry.
The battery was known in the Army of the Potomac as Ayres's
Battery, and under that name won a wide reputation for efficiency.
Ayres himself was a major general of volunteers before the close of
the war, and Lieutenant Du Barry was (May, 1865) brevetted
lieutenant-colonel for distinguished services.</p>

<p>At the time of our visit there was a large number of Indians
encamped on the prairie in front of the fort&mdash;estimated at seven
or eight hundred by those best versed in their manners and customs.
They had come down from the Lower Sioux Agency, sixteen miles
farther up the river. They were alive to the situation, and on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
alert to learn all they could of the "white man's war", which they
had already heard of as being fought in some far-away place, the
location of which was not clear to them, and for which they cared
nothing so long as it promised to be a contest that was likely to
draw away soldiers from the fort, and especially the "big guns",
which they feared more than they did the "dough boys". One of
the best posted of the frontiersmen, a "squaw man", who had the
ear of the tribal council, told our officers that there would be
trouble when the battery was withdrawn, for they felt themselves
able successfully to fight and exterminate the few companies of
infantry left to garrison the fort. How true this prediction was,
the uprising of August, 1862, and the Indian war in Minnesota,
with its massacre at New Ulm and outlying regions, abundantly
verified.</p>

<p>As soon as we were made fast, the work was begun of loading
cannon, caissons, battery wagons, ammunition, and stores, as well
as horses and men. By the light of torches, lanterns, and huge bonfires
built on the bank, the work was rushed all night long, while
the engineers labored to put the engines and particularly the wheel,
in the best possible condition; and the carpenter, aided by artisans
from the fort, put on new guards forward, and strengthened the
weak places for the inevitable pounding that we knew must attend
the downstream trip. With the raging river pressing on the
stern of the boat as she descended, there was ample reason for
anticipating much trouble in handling the steamer.</p>

<p>The teamsters, with their six-mule teams, hurried the stores
and ammunition down the narrow roadway cut in the side of the
bluff, running perhaps half a mile along the side in making the
perpendicular descent of two hundred feet. Whatever time we
had from our duties on the boat was spent either in the fort, out in
the Indian village, or on the side hill watching the teams come
down the bluff, one after the other. Not being able to pass on
the hill, they went down together, and all went back empty at the
same time. The two hind wheels of the big army wagon were
chained, so that they slid along the ground, instead of revolving.
Then the three riders, one on each "near" mule, started the outfit
down the hill, the off mules being next the bluff, while the legs
of the drivers hung out over space on the other side. In places the
wagons would go so fast, in spite of the drag, that the mules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
would have to trot to keep out of the way. This was exciting
and interesting to the spectators, who were expecting to see a
team go over the precipice. The drivers did not seem to care
anything about the matter, and were no doubt well pleased to
become the centre of attraction.</p>

<p>Those of the spectators who had time and patience to continue
the watch were finally rewarded for their persistence, and
justified in their predictions by seeing one of these teams, with
its load of fixed ammunition, roll for a hundred feet down the
bluff&mdash;men, mules, and ammunition in one wild mix-up, rolling
and racing for the bottom. The fringe of timber alone saved
the cortege from plunging into the river. Those who saw the
trip made, were betting that neither a man nor a mule would
come out alive. They all came out alive. Some of the mules
were badly scratched and banged, but not a leg was broken among
the six. The men were also badly bruised, but they also brought
all their bones out whole. One mule had his neck wound around
the wagon-tongue, his own tongue hanging out about the length
of that of the wagon, and all hands were certain of one dead
mule, at least. But when the troopers ran in and cut away the
harness the mule jumped to his feet, took in a few long breaths
to make good for the five minutes' strangulation, and then started
up the roadway, dodging the down-coming teams by a hair's-breadth,
and never stopping until he reached his corral, where he
began munching hay as though nothing out of the ordinary had
happened.</p>

<p>The next morning everything was stowed aboard. With a
salute from the little howitzers in the fort, and the cheers of the
"dough boys", who wanted to go but could not, the "Fanny
Harris" backed into the stream, "straightened up", and began her
downstream trip. I shall not attempt to follow her down, in
all her situations. With the heavy load, and the stream behind
her, it was possible to check her speed in a measure at the bends,
but totally impossible to stop her and back her up against the
current. The result was, that she "flanked" around points that
raked her whole length, and then plunged into timber, bows on,
on the opposite side of the river, ripping the ginger-bread work,
and even the guards, so that it would seem as though the boat
were going to destruction. Some of the artillerymen were sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
of it, and all of them would sooner have risked a battle than
the chance of drowning that at times seemed so imminent. We
made good time, however, and ran the three hundred miles in two
running days of daylight, laying up nights, and repairing damages
as far as possible against the next day's run.</p>

<p>When we rounded to at Fort Snelling landing we had one
chimney about ten feet high above deck; the other was three feet&mdash;just
one joint left above the breeching. Both escape pipes
and the jack staff were gone&mdash;we lost the latter the first day,
going up. The stanchions on both sides of the boiler deck were
swept clean away, together with liberal portions of the roof itself.
The boat looked like a wreck, but her hull was sound. The
officers and crew were game to the last. Many of them had been
hurt more or less, and all had been working until they were scarcely
able to move. It was war time, however. Fort Sumter had
fallen, and the president had called for seventy-five thousand men.
We were doing our part with a will, in hastening forward a
battery that was to give a good account of itself from Bull Run
to Appomattox.</p>

<p>At Fort Snelling we lost two of our firemen and a number
of our deck crew, who deserted while we were lying at that place,
taking on additional stores and men. We thought it a cowardly
thing to do, under the circumstances. A few weeks later, however,
we saw the two firemen going to the front with a volunteer
company from Prescott, afterwards Company "B", 6th Wisconsin
Infantry, in which "Whiskey Jim", the Irishman, and Louis
Ludloff, the "Dutchman", distinguished themselves for valor in
battle. Richardson gave his life for his country at the Wilderness,
while Ludloff fought all the way through, rising from private
to corporal, sergeant, and first sergeant, and being wounded at
Antietam and the Wilderness.</p>

<p>In talking with Ludloff in later years, I learned that the
reason they deserted the steamer, leaving behind their accrued
wages and even their clothes, was because they feared that they
would not be able to get in among the seventy-five thousand if
they lost any time in formalities and details. There were others,
higher up in the world than the humble firemen, who also miscalculated
the length of the impending war&mdash;by four years.
Distinguished editors and statesmen, and even soldiers, made this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
error. And there were a good many who failed to "get in" even
then.</p>

<p>We ran to La Crosse with our pieces of chimneys, which the
artisans at the Fort had helped our engineers to piece together so
that the smoke would clear the pilot house. It did not give the
best of draught; but we were going downstream on a flood, and
we might have drifted five miles an hour without any steam at all.
We delivered the battery at La Crosse, and immediately went into
dry dock, where a hundred men made short work of the repairs.
The United States paid our owners, the Minnesota Packet Company,
eight thousand dollars for the week's work. The officers
and crew who earned the money for the company were not invited
to assist in its division. It was the hardest week's work
that most of us had ever known&mdash;certainly the hardest I had
ever experienced up to that time. A year or so later I got into
work fully as hard, and it lacked the pleasant accessories of good
food and a soft bed, that accompanied the strenuous days and
nights spent on the Fort Ridgeley excursion.</p>

<p>An incident remotely connected with this trip, offers an
excellent opportunity to philosophize on the smallness of the planet
we inhabit, and the impossibility of escaping from, or avoiding
people whom we may once have met. At a meeting of Congregationalists
held in a city far removed from the fort that stood
guard on the bluffs overhanging the Minnesota River in 1861,
the writer was introduced to Mr. Henry Standing Bear, secretary
of the Young Men's Christian Association of Pine Ridge, South
Dakota. Standing Bear is a graduate of Carlisle College, an
educated and intelligent and a full-blood Sioux Indian. In conversation
with him it transpired that he was one of the children
who stared open-eyed at the steamboat lying at the landing place
below the fort in 1861, and that he was an interested spectator of
the embarkation of Sherman's Battery. He there listened to the
talk of the braves who were already planning what they would
do when the soldiers should all be withdrawn to fight the "white
man's war" in the South. Standing Bear's own father took part
in the "massacre", as we called it. Standing Bear says they themselves
called it a war. Indians may go about their killings with
somewhat more of ferocity and cruelty than do we whites, but
it is their way of making war. In either case it is "hell", as "Old
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Tecump" said, and the distinctions that we draw after all make
little difference in the results. We do not have to seek very far
through the pages of history to find instances where white men
have massacred helpless Indian women and children.</p>

<p>A talk with Henry Standing Bear, or any other educated
Indian born amid surroundings such as his, will throw new light
and new coloring upon the Indian situation as it existed in 1861.
They saw the whites steadily encroaching upon their hunting
grounds, appropriating the best to their own use, ravishing their
women, killing their men, and poisoning whole tribes with their
"fire-water". Against their wills they were driven from their
ancient homes&mdash;"removed", was the word&mdash;after having been
tricked into signing treaties that they did not understand, couched
in legal terms that they could not comprehend, receiving in exchange
for their lands a lot of worthless bric-a-brac that vanished
in a week.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> If they protested or resisted, they were shot down
like so many wolves, and with as little mercy. What man is there
among the whites who would not fight under such circumstances?
Our forefathers fought under less provocation and their cause has
been adjudged a righteous cause.</p>

<p>This is the Indian's view-point as stated by a civilized tribesman.
His fathers fought, and are dead. He was adopted by the
nation, educated, and started upon a higher plane of living, as he
is free to confess; but it is doubtful if he can be started upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
higher plane of thinking than that upon which his blanketed forbears
lived, in spite of the cruelties to which they were born and
educated. While I am no sentimentalist on the Indian question,
when I fall into the hands of a Standing Bear I am almost persuaded
that the Indian, within his lights, is as much of a patriot
as many of his bleached brethren. As to his manhood there is no
question. In the long struggle that has taken place between himself
and the white invaders, he has always backed his convictions
with his life, if need be; and such men, if white, we call "patriots."</p>

<i>Improving the River</i></h2>
</div>

<p>It was not until commerce on the upper river was practically
a thing of the past, that any effort was made to improve the
channel for purposes of navigation. A number of interests united
to bring about this good work when it did come&mdash;some meritorious,
others purely selfish. The steamboatmen, what was left of
them, entertained the fallacious idea that if the river were straightened,
deepened, lighted, and freed from snags and other hindrances
to navigation, there would still be some profit in running
their boats, despite the railroad competition that had so nearly
ruined their business. This was a mistaken supposition, and they
were disabused of the idea only by experience.</p>

<p>The mill owners of the upper river and its tributaries, who
had by this time begun to "tow through"&mdash;that is, push their
rafts of logs and lumber with a steamboat from Stillwater to St.
Louis, instead of drifting&mdash;were assured of quicker trips and
greater safety if the river was dressed up somewhat, insuring
greater profits upon their investments. Both of these parties in
interest were engaged in legitimate trade, and while there was no
intention of dividing the profits that might inure to them from
an investment of several millions of dollars of other people's
money, precedent had legitimatized the expenditure in other localities
and upon other rivers. They were well within the bounds
of reason, in asking that their own particular business might be
made more profitable through the aid of government.</p>

<p>A greater influence than any arguments drawn from commercial
necessities was found in the political interest involved.
For years, members of congress elected from districts in which
there was a harbor or a river which by any fiction might be
legislated into a "navigable stream", had been drawing from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
federal treasury great sums of money for the improvement of
these streams and harbors; yet some of these never floated anything
larger than the government yawls in which the engineers
who did the work reached the scene of their duties. At the same
time, country members from the interior of the great West drew
nothing. The rapid settlement of the Northwestern territories,
in the year immediately following the close of the Civil War, had
an effect that was felt in the enhanced influence exerted by members
of congress representing the new commonwealths. It followed
that when the biennial distribution of "pork", as it is
expressively but inelegantly called nowadays, came up, these members
were in a position to demand their share, and get it, or defeat
the distribution <i>in toto</i>.</p>

<p>The war was over. The Union soldiers who had fought in
it were either dead, or if alive were hustling for a living. Hundreds
of thousands of them were found in Iowa, Minnesota,
Kansas, and Nebraska, opening up farms and developing the
country. The contractors who had fattened on their blood were
hanging like leeches to every department of the national government,
clamoring for more contracts to further inflate their already
plethoric bank accounts. The river improvement appealed strongly
to this class of men. The influences that they could bring to
bear, backed by the legitimate demands of steamboatmen and mill
owners, convinced the most conscientious congressmen that their
duty lay in getting as large an appropriation as possible for the
work of river regeneration. The result was, that the river which
had given employment to three or four hundred steamboats,
manned by fifteen thousand men, without having a dollar expended
in ameliorating its conditions, suddenly became the centre
of the greatest concern to congress&mdash;and to the contractors&mdash;and
all for the benefit of a dozen steamboats in regular traffic,
and perhaps a hundred boats used in towing the output of a score
of mills owned by millionaire operators.</p>

<p>From 1866 to 1876 there was spent on the river between the
mouth of the Missouri and St. Paul, a distance of 700 miles, the
sum of $5,200,707. That was for the ten years at the rate of
$7,429 for each mile of the river improved. It cost at that rate
$742.90 per mile per year during the decade quoted. It is doubtful
if the few steamboats engaged in traffic during that time were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
able to show aggregate gross earnings of $742.90 per mile per
annum. It seems a pity that the benefit resulting from this
expenditure could not have been participated in by the great
flotilla that covered the river in the preceding decade, from 1856
to 1866.</p>

<p>In this expenditure we find $59,098 charged to the eleven
miles of river between St. Paul and St. Anthony Falls. It is
doubtful if a dozen trips a year were made to St. Anthony Falls
during the time noted. It was a hard trip to make against the
rapid current below the falls, and a dangerous trip to make downstream.
It would seem, however, that with the expenditure of
$5,909 per year for ten years, over only eleven miles of river,
every rock (and it is all rocks) might have been pulled ashore,
and a perfect canal built up. Possibly that is the result of all
this work; I haven't been over that piece of river since the work
was completed&mdash;for one reason, among others, that no steamboats
ever go to St. Anthony Falls, now that the river is put
in order.</p>

<p>From St. Paul to Prescott, thirty-two miles, there was expended
$638,498 in ten years. I can readily understand why so
much money was planted in that stretch of river. Beginning at
Prescott and going toward St. Paul, there were to be found five
or six of the worst bars there are anywhere on the river; and
between the accentuated bars&mdash;bars of sufficient importance to
merit names of their own&mdash;the rest of the river was bad enough
to merit at least some of the language expended upon it by pilots
who navigated it before the improvements came. At Prescott,
at the head of Puitt's Island (now Prescott Island) or Point
Douglass bar, at Nininger, at Boulanger's Island, at Grey Cloud,
at Pig's Eye, and at Frenchman's, were bars that were the terror
of all pilots and the dread of all owners and stockholders. I will
eliminate the "terror" as expressing the feelings of the pilots.
"Resignation" would perhaps be the better word. They all knew
pretty well where to go to find the best water on any or all of
the bars named; but they also knew that when they found the
best water it would be too thin to float any boat drawing over
three and a half feet. With a four-foot load line it simply meant
that the steamboat must be hauled through six inches of sand by
main strength and awkwardness, and that meant delay, big wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
bills, bigger wage-lists, wear and tear of material, and decreased
earnings. A big packet not loaded below the four-foot line, was
not laden to the money-making point. After the work of regeneration
began, it was a constant fight on the part of the engineers
to maintain a four and a half foot channel on either one of the
bars named. The expenditure of the great sums of money placed
in this district is therefore easily accounted for.</p>

<p>The work of improvement was, and still is carried on under
the direction of competent engineers, detailed for the service by
the chief of engineers of the United States army. No more
highly trained men in their profession can be found in the world
than these choice graduates of the most perfect institution of
instruction in the world&mdash;West Point Military Academy. Their
scientific, perhaps academic, knowledge of the laws governing
the flow of water and the shifting of sands, the erosion of banks
and the silting up into islands and continents, which are among
the vagaries of the great river, is supplemented by the practical,
if unscientific, knowledge of men who have gained their acquaintance
with the river from years of service as pilots or masters of
river steamboats. The government is shrewd enough to secure
the services of such men to complement the science of its chosen
representatives. These two classes, in pairs or by companies,
have made an exhaustive study of conditions surrounding each
of the more difficult and troublesome bars, as well as all others
of lesser note, in order to decide what was needed, what kind of
work, and how to be placed to lead, or drive the water into the
most favorable channels, and there retain it under varying conditions
of flood or drought, ice jams, or any and all the conditions
contributing to the changes forever going on in the river.</p>

<p>These points determined, an estimate is made of the cost
of the necessary improvements, details of construction are drawn,
specifications submitted, and bids on the proposed work invited.
There were, and are, plenty of contractors, provided with boats,
tackle, stone quarries, and all else required in the prosecution of
the work. It would not be safe, however, to assume that the
government always reaped the benefit of so much competition as
might be assumed from the number of men engaged in the business.
It would be unsafe to assume that such competition has
always been free from collusion, although possibly it has been.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
On the other hand, each contractor has his "beat", from which
all other bidders have religiously kept off. Not in an ostentatious
manner, however, for that might invite suspicion; but in a business-like
and gentlemanly manner, by putting in a bid just a few
cents per cubic foot higher than the man upon whose territory
the work was to be done, and whose figures have been secretly
consulted before the bids were submitted. There have been suspicions
that such has been the case, more than once, and that the
work sometimes cost the government more than a fair estimate
had provided for. The contracts have been let, however, and
within the thirty years last past there have been built along the
river between Prescott and St. Paul two hundred and fifty-one
dikes, dams, revetments, and other works for controlling the flow
of water within that short stretch of thirty-two miles.</p>

<p>Some of these dams are long, strong, and expensive; others
are embryonic, a mere suggestion of a dam or dyke, a few feet in
length, for the protection of a particular small portion of the bank,
or for the diverting of the current. All these works, great and
small, are intended as suggestions to the mighty river that in
future it must behave itself in a seemly manner. Generally the
river does take the hint, and behaves well in these particular
cases. At other times it asserts itself after the old fashion, and
wipes out a ten thousand dollar curb in a night, and chooses for
itself a new and different channel, just as it did in the days of its
savagery, fifty years earlier.</p>

<p>A peculiar feature attending this work for the betterment of
the river was, that in its incipient stages it met with little or no
encouragement from any of the men personally engaged in navigating
steamboats on the river. Some deemed the proposition visionary
and impracticable, while others, fearing its success, and magnifying
the results to be obtained, threw every obstacle possible
in the way of the engineers who had the work in charge. They
even went so far as to petition Congress to abandon the work,
and recall the engineers who had been detailed to prosecute it.
This opposition was particularly true of work on the lower rapids,
where the great ship canal now offers a ready and safe passage
around rapids always difficult to navigate. Sometimes, when the
water had reached an unusually low stage, they were positively
impracticable for large boats. Captain Charles J. Allen, Corps of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Engineers, U. S. A., who was in charge of the preliminary work
on the lower rapids, calls attention, in his report, to this hostility,
and incidentally records his opinion of river pilots in general, and
rapids pilots in particular, in the following far from flattering
terms:</p>

<p class="blockquote2">"Most of the river pilots are possessed of but little knowledge beyond
that required in turning the wheel; and their obstinacy in refusing to
recognize and take advantage of good channels cut for them has been the
experience of more than one engineer engaged in improving rivers. The
rapids pilots in particular, who may lose employment, seemed to be the
most hostile."</p>

<p>The last-named class were certainly sound in their conclusions
that the deepening, straightening and lighting of the rapids
would take away their business. There is, therefore, little wonder
that they were not enthusiastic in their support of the proposed
improvements, which were, if successful, to deprive them of the
means of livelihood. Perhaps the gentlemen of the engineer
corps would not be enthusiastic over a proposition to disband the
United States army, and muster out all its officers. The results
justified the fears of the rapids pilots. Any pilot could take his
boat over, after the improvements were completed, and rapids
piloting, as a distinctive business, was very nearly wiped out.</p>

<p>The slur of the West Pointer loses its point, however, with
any one who has known many Mississippi River pilots. They
knew a great many things besides "turning the wheel." Even
had they known only that, they carried around under their hats
special knowledge not to be sneezed at, even by a West Pointer.
Later, all the men on the river came to recognize the benefits
accruing from the work of the Mississippi River Commission, and
none more heartily testified to the success of the work than the
pilots and masters of the river craft. There were, indeed, none
so well qualified to judge of results as they.</p>

<p>The work once begun was prosecuted with vigor. The voice
of the great Northwest was potent in Washington, and in the ten
years from 1866 to 1876 more than five millions of dollars were
expended between Minneapolis and the mouth of the Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The first thought of the government engineers to whom was
entrusted the duty of improving the river, was naturally in the
direction of securing and maintaining a greater depth of water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
This was to be accomplished by so curbing and controlling the
flow that it would follow the channel decided upon, at all times
and under all conditions. The dikes and wing dams, which were
built by the hundred, served this purpose in a degree, and the
flow of water was controlled to a fairly satisfactory extent.</p>

<p>Then the menaces to navigation were considered, and measures
taken for their elimination. Of the two hundred and ninety-five
recorded steamboat wrecks on the Missouri River between
1842 and 1895, a hundred and ninety-three, or about two-thirds
of all, were by snagging. I presume this proportion would be
maintained on the upper Mississippi, if a similar compilation were
at hand to decide the point. The problem was to get rid of this
greatest of all dangers to steamboats. There was but one way,
and that was to pull them out and carry them away, or cut them
up and so dispose of them that the same snag would not have to
be pulled out at each recurring rise of water, from other parts of
the river.</p>

<p>Having no steamboats fitted for the business in that early
day (1866), the contract system was resorted to. This was found
to be costly and unsatisfactory. Contractors agreed to remove
snags at so much per snag, within certain lengths and estimated
weights, they furnishing the steamboats and machinery necessary
for the work. In order to make the business pay, they had to
find snags, somewhere. When they were not to be found in or
near the channel, they were obtained in any place&mdash;chutes,
bayous, and sloughs where no steamboat ever ran, or ever would
run. After a trip or two up and down the river, there were not
enough snags left to make the pulling profitable, and of course
the work was given over. But the first rise brought down a new
supply of snags to lodge in the channel of the falling river, and
pilots set to dodging them, just as they had done before the pulling
began. To be of the highest efficiency, the work must be continuous.
This was deemed impossible under the contract system,
and the engineers in charge recommended the purchase of two
suitable steamboats for the upper river, to be fitted with improved
machinery for lifting and disposing of the snags fished out of the
river. These boats were to be manned and officered by the government,
and placed in charge of an engineer detailed by the War
Department. They were continuously to patrol the river during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the season of navigation, removing every snag as soon as located,
assisting steamboats in distress, cutting overhanging trees, placing
guide-boards and crossing lights where needed, maintaining the
same after being established, and giving their whole time and
attention to the work of river improvement. This suggestion was
carried into effect, and two steamboats purchased and fitted for the
work.</p>

<p>In 1866 Colonel Dodge, of the Corps of Engineers, who had
had large experience in the work of river improvement, realizing
the necessity for dredging the shoalest places, in addition to directing
the water by dikes and dams, invented a dredge to be attached
to a steamboat, and operated by steam machinery, for the purpose
of plowing out and scraping away the sand as it accumulated on
the worst bars and reefs. Two or three experimental machines
were built by a St. Paul mechanic upon the order of the United
States officials, and under their supervision. These were attached
to derricks, placed on the bows of the steamboats secured for the
work, suspended by stout chains, and operated by steam. The
boat, headed up river, was run to the head of the reef; the dredge
was then lowered, and the boat backed downstream in the line
of the channel. The dredge, twenty feet wide, stirred up the
sand, and the scraper attachment drew it down to the foot of the
reef, where the dredge was hoisted up and the current carried
away the released sand into deep water. The boat was again
run to the head of the reef and the operation repeated, each
"scrape" being about the width of the dredge, the pilot so placing
his boat each time as exactly to match the last preceding draft,
without going over the same ground a second time.</p>

<p>The machine was found to work to perfection, and to be of
even greater practical utility in keeping open a navigable channel
than the dikes and wing dams, as there is a constant filling in of
sand at the foot of every channel artificially formed by contracting
the flow of water. The dredge hauls this sand away as it accumulates,
and by deepening the water in the channel does much
toward attracting the steady flow of water to the particular lines
so dredged.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_29"></a>Chapter XXIX<br />
<i>Killing Steamboats</i></h2>
</div>

<p>The upper Mississippi has always been, comparatively, a remarkably
healthy stream for steamboats. A great proportion of
the craft ending their days there, have died of old age, and have
been decorously consigned to the scrap pile instead of meeting the
tragic end usually assigned them by writers. In many cases where
it is supposed or known that a steamboat of a certain name met
destruction by fire or snag, the historian who attempts to verify
such statement will have great difficulty in deciding just which
boat bearing the name was the victim of that particular casualty.
The fact is, that the same name was conferred, time after time,
on boats built to take the place of those sunk, burned, or otherwise
put out of commission. As early as 1840 there was the "Pike No.
8" on the lower river, indicating that there had been a procession
of "Pikes." There was also, at the same time, the "Ben Franklin
No. 7." Boats thus named were called simply "Pike" or "Ben
Franklin", the number not appearing on the wheelhouses, save
in rare cases. All the other "Pikes" having gone to the bottom,
there was but one "Pike" afloat. When reference was ordinarily
made to the boat by that name, the auditors knew at once that
the speaker referred to the boat then in commission. But should
you mention that "When the "Pike" or the "Ben Franklin" was
snagged, or burned, or blew up", in order fully to be understood
you must designate the particular "Pike", and add such other
details, as would leave no room for doubt which boat by that name
you referred to, thus: "Pike No. 6 snagged at such a tow-head,
or on such a bend; or burned in the year 1839 at Hannibal."</p>

<p>Steamboat owners and captains seem to have had no superstitious
objections to thus naming or commanding a successor to
the unfortunate one gone before. Before the first was comfortably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
settled in the mud of the Mississippi, an order had gone on to
the shipyard, and in less than a week the keel was on the stocks
for its successor. If the first was a "Galena", or a "War Eagle",
the second also was a "Galena" or a "War Eagle". This was
before the fashion came into vogue of naming boats after persons,
instead of impersonal objects. There were not names enough to
go around, and thus it came about that the "Warriors", "Post
Boys", "Telegraphs", and "War Eagles" were worked overtime,
to the great confusion of any one attempting to localize a disaster
that had happened to one of that name in times past. It was
possible to read to-day of the total loss of the "War Eagle",
for instance; yet a month or more hence you might hear of the
arrival of the "War Eagle" at St. Paul with a full cargo and
passenger list. The boats might go to the bottom, but the names
went on forever. "Post Boy" was another favorite name handed
down from boat to boat, until seven or eight "Post Boys" had
been launched, run their appointed courses, and met their fate, all
within the span of less than forty years&mdash;an average of about
five years to the boat&mdash;which was a good average for old-time
steamers. On the upper river there were, among others, three
"Burlingtons", two "Chippewas", two "Danubes", two "Denmarks",
two "Dr. Franklins", three "Dubuques", two "Galenas",
three "St. Pauls", three "War Eagles", and many others, doublets
and triplets. All of which tends much to confuse one who is
attempting to run down and locate the history and final disposition
of boats bearing those names.</p>

<p>So far as I can learn, there is no reliable record of all the
losses on the upper river, giving the name of the boat, where,
when, and how lost. It is possible that the final disposition of
boats lost above St. Louis, is as fully covered in the list appended
to the end of this book, as anywhere else extant. Such a record
has been made for the Missouri River by Captain M. H. Chittenden,
of the United States Engineers&mdash;a very complete and historically
valuable statement of the losses on that stream. Other
records are too comprehensive, attempting to give all the losses
through the entire length of the river, from New Orleans to St.
Paul. While covering so much more, territorially, they lack
in the detail that makes the compilation of real worth.</p>

<p>Most writers attach particular stress to boiler explosions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
probably from the fact that they are more spectacular, and the
consequent loss of life usually greater. When a boat is snagged, it
is generally possible to run her ashore in time to save the passengers
and crew, although the vessel itself may prove a total loss. When
a boiler explodes, the boat becomes immediately helpless, so that
it cannot be run ashore, which occasions the considerable loss of
life. In cases of explosion, also, the boat almost invariably burns
in the middle of the river, and there is little chance for escape;
for it is next to impossible to reach the lifeboats carried on the
roof, and if reached it is seldom found possible to launch them.</p>

<p>Before considering the reported losses on all the Western
waters it will be interesting to locate, as far as possible, the
casualties on the Mississippi between St. Louis and St. Paul, the
division or section of the river usually denominated as "upper".
In my list of upper-river boats,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> there are noted all losses of
which I have found any record. The list comprises about three
hundred and sixty steamers that have made one or more trips
above Rock Island. The boats plying above St. Louis, but not
going above the upper rapids, have not been included in this list,
thus excluding all the Alton Line vessels, and the Illinois River
craft. Of the three hundred and sixty boats so listed, there are
to be found records of seventy-three losses between St. Louis and
St. Paul, including the port of St. Louis, which has been a
veritable graveyard for steamboats. About a dozen other boats
were lost after going into the Missouri River trade, but these are
not included in the number stated. The record extends over the
period between 1823 and 1863, inclusive. An analysis of the
causes of such losses shows that thirty-two boats were snagged
and sunk (total losses only are included; those raised, are not
counted as losses); sixteen were burned; ten were sunk by ice;
five were stove in by hitting rocks, and sank; three sank by striking
bridges; three were sunk by Confederate batteries during the war;
two were lost from boiler explosions; one was torn to pieces by
a tornado, and one struck a wreck of another boat and sank
on top of the first wreck.</p>

<p>What became of the other boats included in the list, I am
unable to learn. The United States government appears never
to have printed a report (or reports) showing the fate of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
hundreds of steamboats over which it maintained an official watch-care
while they were in active service. It would seem to have
paid more attention to boiler explosions than to any other cause
of disaster; for the reason, possibly, that it is supposed to have
held itself, through its inspectors, more or less responsible for
the condition of steam boilers. Still, as it also, through another
set of inspectors, looks after the hulls of all steamboats, there
would seem to be no reason why the loss of boats by snagging,
or other similar causes affecting the hulls, should not also have
been reported.</p>

<p>It will be observed that nearly one-half the known losses
on the upper river between 1823 and 1863 were the result of
snagging. Captain Chittenden, in his report on steamboat losses
on the Missouri from 1842 to 1897, gives the snags credit for
catching 193 boats out of a total loss of 295, or two-thirds of all
known losses. Owing to its alluvial banks, and the consequent
eating away of wooded points and islands by the ever changing
current of that most erratic of rivers, the bed of the stream was
literally sown with snags. The wonder of it is, that a pilot was
able ever to take a boat up and back a thousand miles, without
hitting a snag and losing his boat. They did it, however, although
the record of losses from that cause serves to show how imminent
the danger was at all times, and how many came to grief, however
sharp the eyes of the pilot, or however skilled in reading
the surface of the water and locating the danger.</p>

<p>The upper Mississippi has more miles of rock bluffs&mdash;in
fact, is lined with such bluffs from Keokuk to St. Paul; thus
the wear and tear of its banks is not so great as on the Missouri.
Still, the great number of islands, heavily wooded, furnish many
sunken trees, and one-half of the steamboat loss on this river
is also directly traceable to snags.</p>

<p>Next to the snags, which are forever reaching out their
gnarled arms to impale the unfortunate, fire is the greatest enemy
of steamboat property on Western waters. Built of the lightest
and most combustible pine, soaked with oil paint, the upper works
are like tinder when once alight, and danger of this is ever present
in a hundred different forms. A little explosion in the furnaces,
throwing live coals over the deck; over-heated smokestacks, communicating
a blaze to the roof; careless passengers or crew, throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
half-burned matches on deck or into inflammable merchandise
in the freight; or the mass of sparks, cinders, and live coals
continuously falling from the stacks, especially when burning
wood in the furnaces: all these are a constant menace, and with
a blaze once started the chances are a hundred to one that the
boat is lost. A lighted match thrown into a haymow can
scarcely bring quicker results than a little blaze in the upper
works of a steamboat. It flashes up in an instant, and the draft
generated by the progress of the boat instantly carries it the length
of the cabin. In fifteen minutes the upper works are gone.
Sixteen Mississippi boats out of seventy were burned; twenty-five
of 295, on the Missouri. As in losses from ice, so also by fire,
St. Louis has been the storm centre, and for the same reason
namely, the great number of boats there, both summer and
winter. Several visitations from this most dreaded and dreadful
enemy of steamboats are recorded in the history of river navigation,
in which two or more boats were lost while at the St. Louis
landing. But the one which is known far and wide on Western
waters was of such magnitude, and the property loss so great,
as to earn for it the title of the "Great Fire".</p>

<p>This, the most disastrous of all calamities which ever occurred
in the history of navigation in the West, commenced at about
10 o'clock in the evening of May 17, 1849, and continued until
7 o'clock the next morning. Captain Chittenden, the historian
of the Missouri River, says, in describing this catastrophe:</p>

<p class="blockquote2">"Fire alarms had been heard several times early in the evening, but
nothing had come of them, until about the hour above-mentioned, when it
was found that fire had broken out in earnest on the steamer "White
Cloud", which lay at the wharf between Wash and Cherry Streets. The
"Endors" lay just above her and the "Edward Bates" below. Both caught
fire. At this time a well-intended but ill-considered, effort to stop the
progress of the fire was made by some parties, who cut the "Edward
Bates's" moorings and turned her into the stream. The boat was soon
caught by the current and carried down the river; but a strong northeast
wind bore it constantly in shore, and every time it touched it ignited
another boat. An effort was now made to turn other boats loose before
the "Edward Bates" could reach them, but a fatality seemed to attend
every effort. The burning boat outsped them all, and by frequent contacts
set fire to many more. These in turn ignited the rest, until in a
short time the river presented the spectacle of a vast fleet of burning
vessels, drifting slowly along the shore. The fire next spread to the
buildings, and before it could be arrested had destroyed the main business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
portion of the city. It was the most appalling calamity that had ever
visited St. Louis; and followed as it was by the great cholera scourge of
1849, it was a terrible disaster. At the levee there were destroyed twenty-three
steamboats, three barges, and one small boat. The total valuation
of boats and cargoes was estimated at about $440,000, and the insurance
was but $225,000; but this was not all paid, for the fire broke up several
of the insurance companies."</p>

<p>Ice also plays an important part in the game of steamboat
killing. The season on the upper river is short at best. An
early start in the spring, before the railroads had yet reached
St. Paul, brought the greatest financial returns to the daring
and successful captains who, bringing their boats through all the
dangers, arrived safely in harbor at the head of navigation. Great
chances were taken in the fifties, in trying to get through Lake
Pepin before it was clear of ice. The river above and below
was usually clear two weeks before the ice was out of the lake
sufficiently to enable a boat to force its way through. During
the last week of such embargo, boats were constantly butting the
ice at either end of the lake, trying to get up or down, or were
perilously coasting along the shore, where, from the shallowness
of the water and the inflow from the banks, the ice had rotted
more than in the centre of the lake. A change of wind, or a
sudden freshening, catching a boat thus coasting along the shore,
would shove her on to the rocks or sand, and crush her hull as
though it were an eggshell. The "Falls City" was thus caught
and smashed. I myself saw the "Fire Canoe" crushed flat, in
the middle of the lake, a little below Wacouta, Minn., she having
run down a mile or more in the channel which we had broken
with the "Fanny Harris". We had just backed out, for Captain
Anderson had seen signs of a rising wind out of the west, that
would shut the ice into our track. This result did follow after
the other boat had gone in, despite the well-meant warnings of
Anderson, who hailed the other boat and warned them of the
rising wind and the danger to be apprehended. This caution
was ignored by the "Fire Canoe's" captain, who ran his boat
down into the channel that we had broken. The ice did move
as predicted, slowly, so slowly as to be imperceptible unless you
sighted by some stationary object. But it was as irresistible as
fate, and it crushed the timbers of the "Fire Canoe" as though
they were inch boards instead of five-inch planks. The rending
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
of her timbers was plainly heard two miles away. The upper
works were left on the ice, and later we ran down and picked
the crew and passengers off the wreck. When the wind changed
and blew the other way, the cabin was turned over and ground
to splinters amid the moving cakes.</p>

<p>In 1857 the "Galena" was the first boat through the lake
(April 30th). There were twelve other boats in sight at one
time, all butting the ice in the attempt to force a passage and be
the first to reach St. Paul. Of the boats lost on the Missouri River
between 1842 and 1897, twenty-six were lost from ice; on the
upper Mississippi, up to 1863, ten boats succumbed to the same
destroyer.</p>

<p>Not only in Lake Pepin, in the early spring, was this danger
to be apprehended; but in autumn also, in the closing days of
navigation, when the young "anchor ice" was forming, and drifting
with the current, before it had become attached to the banks,
and formed the winter bridge over the river. This was a most
insidious danger. The new ice, just forming under the stress
of zero weather, cut like a knife; and while the boat might feel
no jar from meeting ice fields and solitary floating cakes, all the
time the ice was eating its way through the firm oak planking,
and unless closely watched the bow of the boat would be ground
down so thin that an extra heavy ice floe, striking fairly on the
worn planking, would stave the whole bow in, and the boat would
go to the bottom in spite of all attempts to stop the leak. The
"Fanny Harris" was thus cut down by floating ice and sank in
twenty feet of water, opposite Point Douglass, being a total
loss. Ordinarily, boats intending to make a late trip to the north
were strengthened by spiking on an extra armor sheathing of
four-inch oak plank at the bow, and extending back twenty or
thirty feet.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that the greatest damage from ice
was not experienced at the far north of the upper river, but at
the southern extremity of the run; although many other boats
were lost on the upper reaches, at wide intervals of time and
place. St. Louis was a veritable killing place for steamboats,
from the ice movements. This may be accounted for from the
reason that so many boats wintered at St. Louis. When a break-up
of extraordinary magnitude or unseasonableness did occur, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
had a large number of boats to work upon. Again, the season
of cold, while long and severe on the upper river, was distinctly
marked as to duration. There was no thawing and freezing
again. When the river closed in November, it stayed closed until
the latter end of March, or the early days of April. Then, when
the ice went out, that ended the embargo; there was no further
danger to be feared. Boats did not usually leave their snug-harbors
until the ice had run out; and when they did start, they
had only Lake Pepin to battle with. At St. Louis, on the contrary,
the most disastrous break-ups came unseasonably and unexpectedly,
with the result that the great fleet of boats wintering
there were caught unprepared to meet such an emergency, and
many were lost.</p>

<p>Two such disastrous movements of the ice were experienced
at St. Louis, the first in 1856, the other in 1876. The former
"break-up" occurred February 27, and resulted in the destruction
of a score of the finest boats in the St. Louis trade, and the
partial wrecking of as many more. It put out of commission
in a few hours nearly forty boats, a catastrophe unequalled in
magnitude, either before or since, in the annals of the river. The
disaster was not caused in the usual way, by the thawing of
the ice. In that case it would not have been so disastrous, if
indeed to be feared at all, that being the usual and normal manner
of clearing the river in the spring. The winter had been very
cold, the ice was two or three feet thick, and the water very
low. In this case the movement of the ice was caused by a
sudden rise in the river from above, which caused the ice to
move before it was much, if any, disintegrated. It was an appalling
and terrible exhibition of the power of the Great River
when restrained in its course. The following account is from a
St. Louis paper, printed at the time:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">

<p>"The ice at first moved very slowly and without any perceptible
shock. The boats lying above Chestnut Street were merely shoved ashore.
Messrs. Eads &amp; Nelson's Submarine boat No. 4, which had just finished
work on the wreck of the "Parthenia", was almost immediately capsized,
and became herself a hopeless wreck. Here the destruction commenced.
The "Federal Arch" parted her fastenings and became at once a total
wreck. Lying below her were the steamers "Australia", "Adriatic",
"Brunette", "Paul Jones", "Falls City", "Altoona", "A. B. Chambers", and
the "Challenge", all of which were torn away from shore as easily as
if they had been mere skiffs, and floated down with the immense fields of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
ice. The shock and the crashing of these boats can better be imagined than
described. All their ample fastenings were as nothing against the enormous
flood of ice, and they were carried down apparently fastened and
wedged together. The first obstacles with which they came in contact
were a large fleet of wood-boats, flats, and canal boats. These small fry
were either broken to pieces, or were forced out on to the levee in a very
damaged condition. There must have been at least fifty of these smaller
water craft destroyed, pierced by the ice, or crushed by the pressure of
each against the other.</p>

<p>"In the meantime some of the boats lying above Chestnut Street fared
badly. The "F. X. Aubrey" was forced into the bank and was considerably
damaged. The noble "Nebraska", which was thought to be in a
most perilous position, escaped with the loss of her larboard wheel and
some other small injuries. A number of the upper river boats lying above
Chestnut Street, were more or less damaged. Both the Alton wharf-boats
were sunk and broken in pieces. The old "Shenandoah" and the "Sam
Cloon" were forced away from the shore and floated down together, lodging
against the steamer "Clara", where they were soon torn to pieces and
sunk by a collision with one of the ferry-boats floating down upon them.
The Keokuk wharf-boat maintained its position against the flood and saved
three boats, the "Polar Star", "Pringle", and "Forest Rose", none of which
were injured.</p>

<p>"After running about an hour the character of the ice changed and it
came down in a frothy, crumbled condition, with an occasional solid piece.
At the end of two hours it ran very slowly, and finally stopped at half
past five o'clock, P. M. Just before the ice stopped and commenced to
gorge, huge piles, twenty and thirty feet in height were forced up by the
current on every hand, both on the shore and at the lower dike, where
so many boats had come to a halt. In fact these boats seemed to be literally
buried in ice.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>"The levee on the morning after the day of the disaster presented a
dreary and desolate spectacle, looking more like a scene in the polar
regions than in the fertile and beautiful Mississippi Valley. The Mississippi,
awakened from her long sleep, was pitching along at a wild and
rapid rate of speed, as if to make up for lost time. The ice-coat of mail
was torn into shreds, which lay strewn along the levee, and was in some
places heaped up to a height of twenty feet above the level of the water.
Where the boats had lain in crowds only a few hours before, nothing
was to be seen save this high bulwark of ice, which seemed as if it had
been left there purposely to complete the picture of bleak desolation. The
whole business portion of the levee was clear of boats, except the two
wrecked Alton wharf-boats, which were almost shattered to pieces, and
cast like toys upon the shore in the midst of the ridge of ice. There was
not a single boat at the levee which entirely escaped injury by the memorable
breaking up of the ice on February 27, 1856."</p>

<i>Living It Over Again</i></h2>
</div>

<p>One day in the spring of 1881, after having finished the
business that had called me to St. Paul from my home in River
Falls, Wisconsin (where I was a railway agent and newspaper
proprietor combined), I was loafing about the Grand Central
Station, killing time until my train should be ready to start. The
big whistle of a big boat drew me to the adjacent wharf of the
Diamond Jo Line. The craft proved to be the "Mary Morton".
As soon as the lines were fast, the stages in position, and the
first rush of passengers ashore, I walked aboard and up to the
office. A small man, past middle life, his hair somewhat gray,
was writing in a big book which I recognized as the passenger
journal. By the same token I realized that I was in the presence
of the chief clerk, even if I had not already seen the "mud"
clerk hard at work on the levee, checking out freight. I spoke
to the occupant of the office, and after a few questions and
counter questions I learned that he was Charley Mathers, who
had been on the river before 1860 as chief clerk, and he in turn
learned my name and former standing on the river. From him
I learned that the chief pilot of the steamer was Thomas Burns.
It did not take a great while to get up to the pilot house. I would
not have known my old chief had I not been posted in advance
by Mr. Mathers. This man was grey instead of brown, and
had big whiskers, which the old Tom did not have. He was
sitting on the bench, smoking his pipe and reading a book. He
looked up as I entered, and questioned with his eyes what the
intrusion might mean, but waited until I should state my business.
It took some minutes to establish my identity; but when I did
I received a cordial welcome.</p>

<p>And then we talked of old times and new, and war times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
too&mdash;for he had gone out as captain in an Illinois regiment at
the same time that I went out as a Wisconsin soldier. From a
pilot's view point the old times were simply marvelous as compared
with the present. A hundred and fifty dollars a month,
now, as against six hundred then; and a "wild" pilot, picking
up seventeen hundred dollars in one month as was done by one
man in 1857. Now he couldn't catch a wild boat if he waited
the season through&mdash;there are none. We went over the river,
the steamboats, and the men as we knew them in 1860; and then
we went down below and hunted up George McDonald, the good
old Scotchman, who never swore at you through the speaking
tube, no matter how many bells you gave him in a minute, and who
never got rattled, however fast you might send them; who never
carried more steam than the license called for, and who never missed
a day's duty. The same banter had to be gone through with,
with the same result&mdash;he had forgotten the slim youth who
"shipped up" for him twenty years ago, but whom he promptly
recalled when given a clue. And then, it being train time, we
all walked across to the station and Burns invited me to take a
trip with him, next time, down to St. Louis and back, and work
my way at the wheel.</p>

<p>I knew that I had not yet been weaned from the spokes, and
doubted if I ever should be. I said that I would try, and I did.
I filed an application for the first leave of absence I had ever
asked for from the railroad company, and it was granted. I
found a man to assist the "devil" in getting out my paper, he
doing the editing for pure love of editing, if not from love
of the editor. We set our house in order, packed our trunk and
grips, and when the specified fortnight was ended, we (my wife,
my daughter, and myself) were comfortably bestowed in adjoining
staterooms in the ladies' cabin of the "Mary Morton", and I
was fidgeting about the boat, watching men "do things" as I
had been taught, or had seen others do, twenty years ago or more.</p>

<p>The big Irish mate bullied his crew of forty "niggers",
driving them with familiar oaths, to redoubled efforts in getting
in the "last" packages of freight, which never reached the last.
Among the rest, in that half hour, I saw barrels of mess pork&mdash;a
whole car load of it, which the "nigger" engine was striking down
into the hold. Shades of Abraham! pork <i>out</i> of St. Paul! Twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
years before, I had checked out a whole barge load (three hundred
barrels) through from Cincinnati, by way of Cairo. Cincinnati
was the great porkopolis of the world, while Chicago was yet
keeping its pigs in each back yard, and every freeholder "made"
his own winter's supply of pork for himself. The steward in
charge of the baggage was always in the way with a big trunk
on the gangway, just as of old. The engineers were trying their
steam, and slowly turning the wheel over, with the waste cocks
open, to clear the cylinders of water. The firemen were coaxing
the beds of coal into fiercer heats. The chief clerk compared
the tickets which were presented by hurrying passengers, with
the reservation sheet, and assigned rooms, all "the best", to others
who had no reservations. The "mud" clerk checked his barrels
and boxes, and scribbled his name fiercely and with many flourishes
to last receipts. The pilot on watch, Mr. Burns, sat on the
window ledge in the pilot house, and waited. The captain stood
by the big bell, and listened for the "All ready, Sir!" of the
mate. As the words were spoken, the great bell boomed out one
stroke, the lines slacked away and were thrown off the snubbing
posts. A wave of the captain's hand, a pull at one of the knobs
on the wheel-frame, the jingle of a bell far below, the shiver of
the boat as the great wheel began its work, and the bow of the
"Mary Morton" swung to the south; a couple of pulls at the
bell-ropes, and the wheel was revolving ahead; in a minute more
the escape pipes told us that she was "hooked up", and with full
steam ahead we were on our way to St. Louis. And I was again
in the pilot house with my old chief, who bade me "show us
what sort of an education you had when a youngster".</p>

<p>Despite my forty years I was a boy again, and Tom
Burns was the critical chief, sitting back on the bench with his
pipe alight, a comical smile oozing out of the corners of mouth
and eyes, for all the world like the teacher of old.</p>

<p>The very first minute I met the swing of the gang-plank
derrick (there is no jack staff on the modern steamboat, more's
the pity), with two or three spokes when one would have been
a plenty, yawing the boat round "like a toad in a hailstorm", as
I was advised. I could feel the hot blood rushing to my cheeks,
just as it did twenty years before under similar provocation,
when the eye of the master was upon me. I turned around and
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
<span class="pagenumh"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
found that Mr. Burns had taken it in, and we both laughed
like boys&mdash;as I fancy both of us were for the time.</p>

<p>But I got used to it very soon, getting the "feel of it", and
as the "Mary Morton" steered like a daisy I lined out a very
respectable wake; although Tom tried to puzzle me a good deal
with questions as to the landmarks, most of which I had forgotten
save in a general way.</p>

<p>When eight bells struck, Mr. Link, Mr. Burns's partner,
came into the pilot house; that let me out, and after an introduction
by Mr. Burns, Mr. Link took the wheel. He was a
young man, of perhaps thirty years of age. We lingered a few
minutes to watch him skilfully run Pig's Eye, and then went
down to dinner, and had introductions all around&mdash;to Captain
Boland, Mr. Mathers, Mr. McDonald, and other officers.</p>

<p>I took the wheel again, later in the afternoon. It was easy
steering, and there was no way of getting out of the channel, for
a time; and later I found that some things were taking on a
familiar look&mdash;that I had not forgotten all of the river, and
things were shaping themselves, as each new point or bend was
reached, so that very little prompting was necessary.</p>

<p>I had the wheel from Pine Bend to Hastings, where I was
given permission to step on the end of a board lever fixed in the
floor of the pilot house, on one side of the wheel, and give the
signal of the Diamond Jo Line for the landing&mdash;two long blasts,
followed by three short ones. Here was another innovation. In
old times you had to hold your wheel with one hand while you
pulled a rope to blow for a landing, which was sometimes a little
awkward. This was a very little thing, but it went with the
landing-stage derrick, the electric search-light, and a score of other
improvements that had come aboard since I walked ashore two
decades before.</p>

<p>A mile or two below Hastings I saw the "break" on the
surface of the water which marked the resting-place of the "Fanny
Harris", on which I had spent so many months of hard work,
but which, looked back upon through the haze of twenty years,
now seemed to have been nothing but holiday excursions.</p>

<p>At Prescott I looked on the familiar water front, and into
the attic windows where with my brother I had so often in
the night watches studied the characteristics of boats landing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
the levee. Going ashore I met many old-time friends, among
whom was Charles Barnes, agent of the Diamond Jo Line, who
had occupied the same office on the levee since 1858, and had
met every steamboat touching the landing during all those years.
He was the Nestor of the profession, and was one of the very
few agents still doing business on the water front who had begun
such work prior to 1860. Since then, within a few years past,
he also has gone, and that by an accident, while still in the
performance of duties connected with the steamboat business.</p>

<p>Dropping rapidly down the river, we passed Diamond Bluff
without stopping, but rounded to at Red Wing for passengers and
freight, and afterward headed into a big sea on Lake Pepin,
kicked up by the high south wind that was still blowing. We
landed under the lee of the sand-spit at Lake City, and after getting
away spent the better part of an hour in picking up a barge load
of wheat, that was anchored out in the lake.</p>

<p>By a wise provision of the rules for the government of pilots,
adopted since I left the river, no one is permitted in the pilot
house except the pilot on watch, or his partner, after the sidelights
have been put up. For this reason I could not occupy my
chosen place at the wheel after sunset; but I found enough to
occupy my time down below in the engine-room, watching the
great pitman walk out and in, to and from the crank-shaft,
listening to the rush of the water alongside as it broke into a
great wave on either side, and to the churning of the wheel, and
all the while discussing old times with George McDonald. As
the wind was still high and the water rough, I had an opportunity
to see Mr. McDonald answer bells, which came thick and furious
for a good while before we were well fast to the levee at Reed's
Landing. There was no excitement, however, and no rushing
from side to side as in the old days, to "ship up". He stood
amidship, his hand on the reversing bar, just as a locomotive engineer
sits with his hand on the bar of his engine. When the bell
rang to set her back, he pulled his lever full back, and then opened
his throttle without moving a step. After getting started, and
under full way, he simply "hooked her back" three or four notches,
and the old-time "short link" operation had been performed without
taking a step. A great advance in twenty years! But why
wasn't it thought of fifty years ago? I don't know. The same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
principle had been in use on locomotives from the start. It is
simple enough now, on steamboat engines. Perhaps none of the
old-timers thought of it.</p>

<p>I turned in at an early hour, and lay in the upper berth,
listening to the cinders skating over the roof a couple of feet
above my face, and translating the familiar sounds that reached
me from engine-room and roof&mdash;the call for the draw at the
railroad bridge, below the landing; the signal for landing at
Wabasha; the slow bell, the stopping-bell, the backing-bell, and
a dozen or twenty unclassified bells, before the landing was fully
accomplished; the engineer trying the water in the boilers; the
rattle of the slice-bars on the sides of the furnace doors as the
firemen trimmed their fires; and one new and unfamiliar sound
from the engine-room&mdash;the rapid exhaust of the little engine
driving the electric generator, the only intruder among the otherwise
familiar noises, all of which came to my sleepy senses as
a lullaby.</p>

<p>I listened for anything which might indicate the passage of
the once dreaded Beef Slough bar, but beyond the labored breathing
of the engines, that at times indicated shoaling water, there was
nothing by which to identify our old-time enemy. So listening,
I fell asleep.</p>

<p>"Breakfast is ready, sah", was the pleasant proclamation
following a gentle rapping on the stateroom door. Very refreshing,
this, compared with the sharp manifesto of the olden-days
watchman: "Twelve o'clock; turn out"!</p>

<p>The "Morton" was ploughing along between Victory and
De Soto. By the time justice had been done to the well-cooked
and well-served meal, the boat had touched at the latter port and
taken on a few sacks of barley (potential Budweiser), consigned
to one of the big St. Louis breweries. Mr. Link was at the
wheel, and as a good understanding had been reached the day
before, there was no question as to who was going to do the
steering. Mr. Link took the bench and talked river as only a
lover could talk, while I picked out the course by the aid of
diamond boards and ancient landmarks, without asking many
questions. A suggestion now and then: "Let her come in a
little closer". "Now you may cross over". "Look out for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
snag in the next bend", and like cautions were all that was
necessary.</p>

<p>And the pleasure of it! The beautiful morning in June,
the woods alive with songbirds; the bluffs and islands a perfect
green; the river dimpling under the caresses of a gentle breeze,
and blushing rosy under the ardent gaze of the morning sun&mdash;a
picture of loveliness not to be outdone anywhere in the wide
world. And then the sense of power that comes to one who has
learned to handle a steamboat with a touch of the wheel, in taking
a long bend, a mile or more in length, without moving the wheel
an inch, the rudders so slightly angled as to guide the boat along
the arc of a circle which would be ten miles in diameter, could
it be extended to completion, and leaving a wake as true as
if drawn by a pair of dividers!</p>

<p>We did not go into Prairie du Chien, but with the glasses
the old French town could be discerned across the island and
the slough; it claims to be two hundred years old, and it looked
its age. Time was when Prairie du Chien, the terminus of the
railroad nearest to St. Paul and the upper river, gave promise
of being a big city, the outlet and <i>entrepôt</i> for the trade of a
great territory. Her people believed in her, and in her great
future. A dozen steamboats might be seen, on many occasions,
loading merchandise from the railroad, or unloading grain and
produce, in sacks and packages, destined to Milwaukee and Chicago.
When I was second clerk I once checked out twenty
thousand sacks of wheat in something over thirty-six hours, the
cargo of boat and two barges. The wheat now goes through
in bulk, in box cars loaded in Iowa and Minnesota, and they do
not even change engines at Prairie du Chien, the roundhouse
and division terminal being located at McGregor, on the west
side of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>At McGregor I saw Joseph Reynolds, at that time owner
of five fine steamers, and manager of the Diamond Jo Line.
Captain Burns pointed out a man dressed in a dark business
suit, sitting on a snubbing post, lazily and apparently indifferently
watching the crew handling freight, or looking over the steamer
as if it were an unusual and curious sight. He did not speak
to any of the officers while we were watching him, and Mr.
Burns thought it very unlikely that he would. He did not come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
on board the boat at all, but sat and whittled the head of the
post until we backed out and left him out of sight behind. Mr.
Burns allowed that "Jo" was doing a heap of thinking all the
time we were watching him, and that he probably did not think
of the boat, as a present object of interest, at all.</p>

<p>Joseph Reynolds began his river experience in 1867 with
one small boat, carrying his own wheat, and towing a barge
when the steamer could not carry it all. When we saw him
holding down a snubbing post at McGregor he owned and operated,
under the title of the "Diamond Jo Line", the "Mary
Morton", "Libbie Conger", "Diamond Jo", "Josephine", and
"Josie", all well equipped and handsome steamers. Later, he
added the "Sidney", the "Pittsburg", the "St. Paul", and the
"Quincy", still larger and better boats.</p>

<p>That night I witnessed for the first time the operation of
the electric search-light as an aid to navigation. The night came
on dark and stormy, a thunder shower breaking over the river
as we were running the devious and dangerous Guttenburg channel,
about five or six miles below the town by that name. Instead
of straining his eyes out of his head, hunting doubtful landmarks
miles away, as we used to do, Mr. Link tooted his little whistle
down in the engine-room, and instantly the light was switched
on to the lantern at the bow of the boat. Lines running from
the pilot house gave perfect control of the light, and it was flashed
ahead until it lighted up the diamond boards and other shore-marks
by which the crossings were marked and the best water indicated
to the pilot. Under a slow bell he worked his way down the
ugly piece of river without touching. He had the leads two or
three times, just to assure himself, but apparently he could have
made it just as well without them.</p>

<p>A mile and a half above the mouth of Turkey River, in
the very worst place of all, we found a big log raft in trouble,
hung up on the sand, with a steamboat at each end working at
it. They occupied so much of the river that it took Mr. Link
over an hour to get past the obstruction, the search-light in the
meantime turning night into day, and enabling him to look down
on the timber and see just where the edge of the raft was. By
backing and flanking he finally squeezed past, but not without
scraping the sand and taking big chances of getting hung up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
himself. Coming back, we did hang up for an hour or more
in the same place, a mile above the foot of Cassville Slough.
Without the aid of the search-light it would have been impossible
to have worked the steamer past the raft until daylight came.
It is a wonderful aid to navigation, and it is as easy to run
crooked places by night as by day, with its assistance.</p>

<p>In St. Louis, after seeing Shaw's Garden and tasting the old
French market, the best thing you can do is to go back to the
levee and watch the river, the big Eads bridge, the boats, and
the darkies. There may be no boats other than the one you came
on and are going back upon, but you will not miss seeing the bridge,
and you must not miss seeing the darkies. They are worth studying&mdash;much
better than even imported shrubbery.</p>

<p>There was an Anchor Line boat moored just below us the
day we were there, a big side-wheeler, in the New Orleans trade,
sixteen hundred tons. The "Mary Morton" was four hundred
and fifty, and had shrunk perceptibly since the big liner came
alongside. There were two or three other boats, little ones, ferries
and traders, sprinkled along the three miles of levee. In 1857
I have seen boats lying two deep, in places, and one deep in
every place where it was possible to stick the nose of a steamboat
into the levee&mdash;boats from New Orleans, from Pittsburg, from
the upper Mississippi, from the Missouri, from the Tennessee
and the Cumberland, the Red River and the Illinois, loaded with
every conceivable description of freight, and the levee itself piled
for miles with incoming or outgoing cargoes. Now, it was enough
to make one sick at heart. It seemed as if the city had gone
to decay. The passage of a train over the bridge every five
minutes or less, each way, reassured one on that point, however,
and indicated that there was still plenty of traffic, and that it
was only the river that was dead, and not the city.</p>

<p>In old times the steamboat crews were comprised principally
of white men&mdash;that is, deck hands and roustabouts (or stevedores).
The firemen may have been darkies, and the cabin crews were
more than likely to have been, but the deck crews were generally
white. Now, the deck crews are all colored men. They are a
happy-go-lucky set, given to strong drink and craps, not to mention
some other forms of vice. In old times the crews were hired
by the month. The members of a modern deck crew never make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
two trips consecutively on the same boat. The boat does not
lay long enough in St. Louis to give them time to spend ten days'
wages, and then get sober enough, or hungry enough, to reship
for another trip. Therefore, as soon as the last package of freight
is landed, the crew marches to the window of the clerk's office
opening out onto the guards, and gets what money is coming
to each individual after the barkeeper's checks have been deducted.
With this wealth in hand the fellow makes a straight wake for
one of the two or three score dives, rum-holes, and bagnios that
line the levee. He seldom leaves his favorite inn until his money
is gone and he is thrown out by the professional "bouncer"
attached to each of these places of entertainment.</p>

<p>The boat does not remain without a crew, however. While
one of the clerks is paying off the old crew, another has gone out
on the levee with a handful of pasteboard tickets, one for each
man he desires to ship for the next round trip to St. Paul.
Mounting the tallest snubbing post at hand, he is instantly surrounded
by a shouting, laughing, pushing, and sometimes fighting
mass of negroes, with an occasional alleged white man. This
mob of men are clothed in every conceivable style of rags and
tatters, and all are trying to get near the man on the post.</p>

<p>After a minute's delay the clerk cries out: "All set! Stand
by"! and gives his handful of tickets a whirl around his head,
loosening them a few at a time, and casting them to every point of
the compass so as to give all a fair chance to draw a prize. The
crowd of would-be "rousters" jump, grab, wrestle, and fight
for the coveted tickets, and the man who secures one and fights
his way victoriously to the gang plank is at once recorded in the
mate's book as one of the crew. The victorious darky comes
up the gang plank showing every tooth in his head. It is the
best show to be seen in St. Louis.</p>

<p>"Why do they not go out and pick out the best men and hire
them in a business-like and Christian-like manner?" inquires the
unacclimated tourist.</p>

<p>"Because this is a better and very much quicker way", says
the mate, who knows whereof he speaks. "The nigger that can
get a ticket, and keep it until he gets to the gang plank, is the
nigger for me. He is the 'best man'; if he wasn't he wouldn't
get here at all. Some of 'em don't get here&mdash;they carry 'em
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
off to the hospital to patch 'em up; sometimes they carry 'em off
and plant 'em. There wasn't much of a rush to-day. You ought
to see 'em in the early spring, when they are pretty hungry after
a winter's freezing and fasting, and they want to get close to a
steamboat boiler to get warm. There was not more'n three
hundred niggers out there to-day. Last April there was a thousand,
and they everlastingly scrapped for a chance to get close
to the post. Some of 'em got their 'razzers', and sort of hewed
their way in. The clerk got a little shaky himself. He was
afraid they might down him and take the whole pack."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think that you would care to ship the men with
'razzers' as you call them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind that if they can tote well. Anyway,
they all have 'em. They don't use them much on white men,
anyhow. And then we look out for them. After we back out
from here they will get enough to do to keep them busy. They
don't carry any life insurance, and they don't want to fool with
white folks, much."</p>

<p>Having watched the mates handling the crew on the down
trip one could form a pretty clear judgment why the "niggers"
were not solicitous to "fool with" the white men with whom
they were in contact while on the river.</p>

<p>That night we steamed across to East St. Louis and took
on three thousand kegs of nails for different ports on the upper
river. These were carried on the shoulders of the newly-hired
deck crew a distance of at least two hundred feet from the railroad
freight house to the boat; every one of the forty men "toting"
seventy-five kegs, each weighing a hundred and seven pounds.
At the conclusion of this exercise it is safe to say that they were
glad enough to creep under the boilers so soon as the boat pulled
out from the landing. The next morning we were well on our
way up the river. I steered most of the daylight watches for
Mr. Link all the way upstream. He had a terrible cough, and
was very weak, but had the hopefulness which always seems to
accompany that dread disease (consumption), that he "would
soon get over it". I was glad to relieve him of some hard work,
and I was also greatly pleased again to have an opportunity to
handle a big boat. Poor fellow, his hopefulness was of no avail.
He died at his home in Quincy within two years of that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
We arrived at St. Paul on schedule time, with no mishaps to
speak of, and I parted with regret from old and new friends on
the boat, none of whom I have ever seen since that parting twenty-five
years ago. Thomas Burns, Henry Link, George McDonald,
and Captain Boland are all dead. Charles Mathers, the chief
clerk, was living a few years ago at Cairo, an old man, long
retired from active service.</p>

<p>As we started to leave the boat, we were arrested by an
outcry, a pistol shot, and the shouting of the colored deck hands,
followed by the rush of the mate and the fall of one of the men,
whom he had struck with a club or billet. Still another colored
man lay groaning on the wharf, and a white man was binding
up an ugly gash in his neck made by the slash of a razor. In
a few minutes the clang of the patrol wagon gong was heard, as
it responded to the telephone call, and two darkies were carried
off, one to the hospital and the other to the jail. The slightly-interrupted
work of toting nail kegs was then resumed. Thus
the last sights and sounds were fit illustrations of river life as it
is to-day, and as it was a half a century ago&mdash;strenuous and
rough, indeed, but possessing a wonderful fascination to one who
has once fallen under the influence of its spell.</p>

<h2><a name="appendix_A"></a>Appendix A<br />
<i>List of Steamboats on the Upper Mississippi River,<br />
1823-1863</i></h2>

<p>In the following compilation I have endeavored to give as
complete a history as possible of every boat making one or more
trips on the upper Mississippi River&mdash;that is to say, above the
upper rapids&mdash;prior to 1863, not counting boats engaged exclusively
in the rafting business. Owing to the repetition of names
as applied to different steamers, which were built, ran their
course, and were destroyed, only to be followed by others bearing
the same name, it is altogether likely that some have escaped
notice. Others that may have made the trip have left no sign.
In nearly every case the record is made either at St. Paul or at
Galena. Whenever possible, the names of the master and clerk
are given. Where boats were running regularly in the trade
but one notation is made: "St. Paul, 1852; 1854; etc.", which
might include twenty trips during the season. The record covers
the period from 1823, when the first steamer, the "Virginia",
arrived at St. Peters from St. Louis, with government stores for
Fort Snelling, up to 1863, one year after the writer left the river.</p>

<h2><a name="appendix_E"></a>Appendix E<br />
<i>Indian Nomenclature and Legends</i></h2>

<p>The name Mississippi is an amelioration of the harsher syllables
of the Indian tongue from which it sprang. Dr. Lafayette
H. Bunnell, late of Winona, Minnesota, a personal friend and old
army comrade, is my authority for the names and spelling given
below, as gleaned by him during many years' residence among
the Chippewa of Wisconsin and the Sioux (or Dakota) of
Minnesota. Dr. Bunnell spoke both languages fluently, and in
addition made a scholarly study of Indian tongues for literary
purposes. His evidence is conclusive, that so far as the northern
tribes were concerned the Mississippi was in the Chippewa language,
from which the name is derived: <i>Mee-zee</i> (great), <i>see'-bee</i>
(river)&mdash;Great River. The Dakota called it <i>Wat-pah-tah'-ka</i>
(big river). The Sauk, Foxes, and Potawatomi, related tribes,
all called it: <i>Mee-chaw-see'-poo</i> (big river). The Winnebago
called it: <i>Ne-scas-hut'-ta-ra</i> (the bluff-walled river). Thus six
out of seven tribes peopling its banks united in terming it the
"Great River".</p>

<p>Dr. Bunnell disposes of the romantic fiction that the Indians
called it the "Great Father of Waters", by saying that in Chippewa
this would be: <i>Miche-nu-say'-be-gong</i>&mdash;a term that he
never heard used in speaking of the stream; and old Wah-pa-sha,
chief of the Dakota living at Winona, assured the Doctor that
he had never heard an Indian use it. The Chippewa did, however,
have a superlative form of the name: <i>Miche-gah'-see-bee</i>
(great, endless river), descriptive of its (to them) illimitable
length.</p>

<p>Dr. Bunnell suggests the derivation of the name Michigan,
as applied to the lake and state. The Chippewa term for any
great body of water, like Lakes Michigan, Superior, or Huron, is:
<i>Miche-gah'-be-gong</i> (great, boundless waters). It was very easy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
for the white men who first heard this general term as applied
to the lake, to accept it as a proper name, and to translate the
Indian term into Michigan, as we have it to-day.</p>

<p>It is a source of gratification that the names applied to the
Great River by the Jesuit fathers who first plied their birch-bark
canoes upon its surface, did not stick. They were wonderful men,
those old missionaries, devoted and self-sacrificing beyond belief;
but when it came to naming the new-found lands and rivers, there
was a monotony of religious nomenclature. Rivière St. Louis
and Rivière de la Conception are neither of them particularly
descriptive of the Great River. In this connection it must be
said, however, that there was something providential in the zeal
of the good missionaries in christening as they did, the ports at
either end of the upper river run. The mention of St. Louis
and St. Paul lent the only devotional tinge to steamboat conversation
in the fifties. Without this there would have been nothing
religious about that eight hundred miles of Western water. Even
as it was, skepticism crept in with its doubts and questionings.
We all know who St. Paul was, and his manner of life; but it is
difficult to recall just what particular lines of holiness were followed
by Louis XIV to entitle him to canonization.</p>

<p>Trempealeau Mountain, as it is called, situated two miles
above Trempealeau Landing, Wisconsin, is another marvel of nature
that attracted the attention of the Indians. It is an island
of limestone, capped with sandstone, rising four hundred feet above
the level of the river. Between the island and the mainland is
a slough several hundred feet wide, which heads some five or six
miles above. The Winnebago gave it a descriptive name: <i>Hay-me-ah'-shan</i>
(Soaking Mountain). In Dakota it was <i>Min-nay-chon'-ka-hah</i>
(pronounced Minneshon'ka), meaning Bluff in the
Water. This was translated by the early French voyageurs into:
<i>Trempe à l'eau</i>&mdash;the Mountain that bathes its feet in the water.
There is no other island of rock in the Mississippi above the upper
rapids; none rising more than a few feet above the water.</p>

<p>It is but natural that the Indians who for centuries have
peopled the banks of the Mississippi, should have many legends
attaching to prominent or unusual features of the river scenery.
Where the Indians may have failed, imaginative palefaces have
abundantly supplied such deficiencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
There is one legend, however, that seems to have had its
foundation in fact&mdash;that of the tragedy at Maiden Rock, or
Lover's Leap, the bold headland jutting out into Lake Pepin on
the Wisconsin side, some six or eight miles below the head of the
lake. Dr. Bunnell devoted much study to this legend, and his
conclusion is that it is an historic fact. Divested of the multiplicity
of words and metaphor with which the Indian story-teller, the
historian of his tribe, clothes his narrative, the incident was this:</p>

<p>In the days of Wah-pa-sha the first, chief of the Dakota band
of that name, there was, in the village of Keoxa, near the site of
the present Minnesota city of Winona, in the latter part of the
eighteenth century, a maiden whose name was Winona (<i>Wi-no-na</i>:
first-born daughter). She had formed an attachment for a young
hunter of the tribe, which was fully reciprocated by the young
man. They had met often, and agreed to a union, on which all
their hopes of happiness centered. But on applying to her
family, the young suitor was curtly dismissed with the information
that the girl had been promised to a warrior of distinction who
had sued for her hand. Winona, however, persisted in her preference
for the hunter; whereupon the father took measures to
drive him out of the village, and the family began to use harsh
measures to coerce the maiden into a union with the warrior
whom they had chosen for her husband. She was finally assured
that she was, with or without her consent, to be the bride of the
man of their choice.</p>

<p>About this time a party was formed to go to Lake Pepin to
lay in a store of blue clay, which they used as a pigment. Winona,
with her family, was of the party. Arriving at their destination
the question of her marriage with the warrior again came up, and
she was told that she would be given to him that very day. Upon
hearing this final and irrevocable decree the girl withdrew, and
while the family were preparing for the wedding festival she
sought the top of the bluff now known as Maiden Rock. From
this eminence she called down to her family and friends, telling
them that she preferred death to a union with one she did not love,
and began singing her death song. Many of the swiftest runners
of the tribe, with the warrior to whom she had been sold, immediately
ran for the summit of the cliff in order to restrain her;
but before they reached her she jumped headlong from the height,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
and was dashed to pieces on the jagged rocks a hundred and fifty
feet below.</p>

<p>This story was in 1817 related to Major Long, of the United
States Army, by a member of Wahpasha's tribe, Wa-ze-co-to, who
claimed to have been an eyewitness of the tragedy. Wazecoto
was an old man at the time, and his evident feeling as he related
the tale went far toward convincing Major Long that the narrator
was reciting the tale of an actual occurrence.</p>

<p>Maiden Rock itself is a bluff about four hundred feet in
height. One hundred and fifty feet of it is a sheer precipice; the
other two hundred and fifty is a steep bluff covered with loose
rocks, and grown up to straggling scrub oaks. Some versions of
the legend state that Winona in her grief leaped from the bluff into
the waters of the lake and was drowned. On my only visit to
the top of the Leap, in company with Mr. Wilson, the mate, we
found it somewhat difficult to throw a stone into the water from
the top of the bluff. If Winona made it in one jump she must
have been pretty lithe, even for an Indian.</p>

<p>I hope that I may not be dubbed an iconoclast, in calling attention
to the fact that Indian stories similar to this have been localized
all over our country. Lovers' Leaps can be counted by the score,
being a part of the stock in trade of most summer resorts. Another
difficulty with the tale is, that the action of the young pair does
not comport with the known marriage customs of Indians.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> The "stroke" of an engine is the distance traveled by the cross-head
of the piston in making a complete revolution of the wheel&mdash;equal to
twice the length of the crank on the water-wheel shaft. If the crank is
three feet long, the stroke will be six feet. The stroke of the "Grey Eagle"
of the Minnesota Packet Company was seven feet; that of the "J. M.
White", lower river boat, was eleven feet. The cylinders of course
equaled the full stroke in length. The longer the crank the greater the
purchase, but at a consequent loss in the number of revolutions of the
wheel per minute.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> "Mud" Clerk: Second clerk, whose duty it was to go out in all
weathers, upon the unpaved levees and deliver or receive freight. As
the levees were usually muddy in rainy weather, the name became
descriptive of the work and condition of the second clerk.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Captain Thomas W. Burns was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in
1836. He removed with his parents to Galena, Illinois, in 1842, where he
received his education in the public schools. After leaving school he went
on the river as a "cub" pilot, and upon reaching the age of 21 years received
his certificate as first-class pilot between St. Louis and St. Paul, in which
capacity he served on many of the best boats of the Minnesota Packet
Company, including the "War Eagle," "Key City," "Itasca," "Fanny
Harris," "Kate Cassell," and others. In 1861 he recruited a company of
steamboatmen at Galena, and was assigned to the 45th Illinois Infantry.
He remained with his company until after the capture of Fort Henry,
when he was discharged for disability. Upon his return to Galena he
took up the work of piloting again, continuing until 1885, when he was
appointed by President Cleveland to the office of United States Local
Inspector of Steamboats, with headquarters at Galena. His long years of
experience on the river, and his high sense of duty made him an excellent
official, and upon the advent of a Republican administration he was reappointed
to the office, in which he was serving at the time of his death,
March 4, 1890.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Observe the minuteness with which the Captain remembers the
small and insignificant details of this trip. It is a guarantee that his
memory is not playing any tricks in his narrative of the more important
happenings.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> A boat <i>measuring</i> 200 tons would carry from 300 to 350 tons weight
in cargo. The tonnage of all boats is given by measurement, while the
cargo is always in hundredweights.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Captain Daniel Smith Harris was born in the state of Ohio in 1808.
He came with his parents to Galena, Ill., in 1823, where he attended the
frontier schools, and worked in the lead mines until 1836, when he commenced
his career as a steamboatman, which was developed until he
should become known as the greatest of all the upper river steamboat
owners and captains. In the year 1836, in company with his brother, R.
Scribe Harris, who was a practical engineer, he built the steamer "Frontier,"
which he commanded that season. In 1837 the two brothers brought
out the "Smelter," which was commanded by Daniel Smith Harris, Scribe
Harris running as chief engineer. In 1838 they built the "Pre-Emption,"
which was also run by the two brothers. In 1839 they built the "Relief,"
and in 1840 the "Sutler," both of which he commanded. In 1841 they
brought out the "Otter," which Captain Harris commanded until 1844,
when the two brothers built the "War Eagle" (first), which he commanded
until 1847. In 1848 he commanded the "Senator"; in 1849 the "Dr.
Franklin No. 2"; in 1850 and 1851 the "Nominee"; in 1852 the "Luella,"
"New St. Paul" and "West Newton"; in 1853 the "West Newton"; 1854,
1855 and 1856 the "War Eagle" (second), which he built. (See picture
of "War Eagle" on page 120.) In 1857 Captain Harris built the "Grey
Eagle," the largest, fastest and finest boat on the upper river up to that
time, costing $63,000. He commanded the "Grey Eagle" until 1861, when
she was lost by striking the Rock Island Bridge, sinking in five minutes.
Captain Harris then retired from the river, living in Galena until his
death in 189-. As a young man he took part, as a Lieutenant of Volunteers,
in the battle of Bad Axe, with the Indians under Chief Black Hawk.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> This is a pretty wild statement on the part of Standing Bear,
probably made through ignorance of the facts in the case rather than a
wilful misrepresentation. In the treaty made with the Sioux Indians at
Traverse des Sioux, July 2-3, 1851, the United States covenanted to pay
$1,665,000 for such rights and title as were claimed by the Sisseton and
Wahpeton tribes or bands in lands lying in Iowa and Minnesota. In
another treaty, made with the M'day-wa-kon-ton and Wak-pay-koo-tay
bands, also of the Sioux nation, the United States agreed to pay the
further sum of $1,410,000 for the rights of these two bands in lands
lying in Iowa and Minnesota. In addition the Sioux had already been
paid a large sum for their rights in lands lying on the east side of the
Mississippi, in Wisconsin&mdash;lands in which they really had no right of
title at all, as they had gained whatever rights they claimed simply by
driving back the Chippewa from the country which they had occupied
for generations. The Sioux themselves did not, and could not, avail
themselves of the rights so gained, and the territory was a debatable land
for years&mdash;a fighting ground for the rival nations of the Sioux and
Chippewa.</p>
